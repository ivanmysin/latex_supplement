We developed genetic labeling and imaging methods to examine synaptic proteins in individual excitatory synapses across all regions of the mouse brain. Synapse catalogs were generated from the molecular and morphological features of a billion synapses. Each synapse subtype showed a unique anatomical distribution, and each brain region showed a distinct signature of synapse subtypes. Whole-brain synaptome cartography revealed spatial architecture from dendritic to global systems levels and previously unknown anatomical features. Synaptome mapping of circuits showed correspondence between synapse diversity and structural and functional connectomes. Behaviorally relevant patterns of neuronal activity trigger spatiotemporal postsynaptic responses sensitive to the structure of synaptome maps. Areas controlling higher cognitive function contain the greatest synapse diversity, and mutations causing cognitive disorders reorganized synaptome maps.

	abstract = {A framework for cognitive spaces
Ever since Tolman's proposal of cognitive maps in the 1940s, the question of how spatial representations support flexible behavior has been a contentious topic. Bellmund et al. review and combine concepts from cognitive science and philosophy with findings from neurophysiology of spatial navigation in rodents to propose a framework for cognitive neuroscience. They argue that spatial-processing principles in the hippocampalentorhinal region provide a geometric code to map information domains of cognitive spaces for high-level cognition and discuss recent evidence for this proposal.
Science, this issue p. eaat6766
Structured Abstract
{BACKGROUNDEver} since Edward Tolman’s proposal that comprehensive cognitive maps underlie spatial navigation and, more generally, psychological functions, the question of how past experience guides behavior has been contentious. The discovery of place cells in rodents, signaling the animal’s position in space, suggested that such cognitive maps reside in the hippocampus, a core brain region for human memory. Building on the description of place cells, several other functionally defined cell types were discovered in the hippocampal-entorhinal region. Among them are grid cells in the entorhinal cortex, whose characteristic periodic, six-fold symmetric firing patterns are thought to provide a spatial metric. These findings were complemented by insights into key coding principles of the hippocampal-entorhinal region: Spatial representations vary in scale along the hippocampal long axis, place cells remap to map different environments, and sequential hippocampal activity represents nonlocal trajectories through space. In humans, the existence of spatially tuned cells has been demonstrated in presurgical patients, and functional magnetic resonance imaging provides proxy measures for the noninvasive investigation of these processing mechanisms in human cognition. Intriguingly, recent advances indicate that place and grid cells can encode positions along dimensions of experience beyond Euclidean space for navigation, suggesting a more general role of hippocampal-entorhinal processing mechanisms in cognition.
{ADVANCESWe} combine hippocampal-entorhinal processing mechanisms identified in spatial navigation research with ideas from cognitive science describing a spatial representational format for cognition. Cognitive spaces are spanned by dimensions satisfying geometric constraints such as betweenness and equidistance, enabling the representation of properties and concepts as convex regions of cognitive space. We propose that the continuous population code of place and grid cells in the hippocampal-entorhinal region maps the dimensions of cognitive spaces. In these, each stimulus is located according to its feature values along the relevant dimensions, resulting in nearby positions for similar stimuli and larger distances between dissimilar stimuli. The low-dimensional, rigid firing properties of the entorhinal grid system make it a candidate to provide a metric or distance code for cognitive spaces, whereas hippocampal place cells flexibly represent positions in a given space. This mapping of cognitive spaces is complemented by the additional coding principles outlined above: Along the hippocampal long axis, cognitive spaces are mapped with varying spatial scale, supporting memory and knowledge representations at different levels of granularity. Via hippocampal remapping, spaces spanned by different dimensions can be flexibly mapped and established maps can be reinstated via attractor dynamics. The geometric definition of cognitive spaces allows flexible generalization and inference, and sequential hippocampal activity can simulate trajectories through cognitive spaces for adaptive decision-making and behavior.
{OUTLOOKCognitive} spaces provide a domain-general format for processing in the hippocampal-entorhinal region, in line with its involvement beyond navigation and memory. Spatial navigation serves as a model system to identify key coding principles governing cognitive spaces. An important question concerns the extent to which firing properties of spatially tuned cells are preserved in cognitive spaces. Technological advances such as calcium imaging will clarify coding principles on the population level and facilitate the translation to human cognitive neuroscience. Spatial navigation is mostly investigated in two dimensions and naturally limited to three dimensions; however, the processing of complex, multidimensional concepts is vital to high-level human cognition, and the representation of such high-dimensional spaces is an intriguing question for future research. Further, the role of brain networks acting in concert with the hippocampus, in navigation specifically and cognitive function in general, will provide insight into whether and how cognitive spaces are supported beyond the hippocampal-entorhinal region. Finally, the precise way in which cognitive spaces and trajectories through them are read out for behavior remains to be elucidated. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/362/6415/eaat6766/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Place and grid cells map cognitive spaces.Cognitive spaces are defined by dimensions satisfying geometric constraints. The example space (left) is spanned by the dimensions of engine power and car weight. Black dots show different vehicles whose positions reflect their feature combinations. Place cells (center; colored circles represent firing fields of different cells) and grid cells (right; circles illustrate firing pattern of one cell) provide a continuous code for cognitive spaces.
The hippocampal formation has long been suggested to underlie both memory formation and spatial navigation. We discuss how neural mechanisms identified in spatial navigation research operate across information domains to support a wide spectrum of cognitive functions. In our framework, place and grid cell population codes provide a representational format to map variable dimensions of cognitive spaces. This highly dynamic mapping system enables rapid reorganization of codes through remapping between orthogonal representations across behavioral contexts, yielding a multitude of stable cognitive spaces at different resolutions and hierarchical levels. Action sequences result in trajectories through cognitive space, which can be simulated via sequential coding in the hippocampus. In this way, the spatial representational format of the hippocampal formation has the capacity to support flexible cognition and behavior.},

Field potentials and unit activity were recorded by multiple site silicon probes (5- and 16-site shanks) and wire electrode arrays. Gamma waves were highly coherent along the long axis of the dentate hilus, but average coherence decreased rapidly in the {CA}3 and {CA}1 directions. Analysis of short epochs revealed large fluctuations in coherence values between the dentate and {CA}1 gamma waves. Current source density analysis revealed large sinks and sources in the dentate gyrus with spatial distribution similar to the dipoles evoked by stimulation of the perforant path. The frequency changes of gamma and theta waves positively correlated (40–100 Hz and 5–10 Hz, respectively). Putative interneurons in the dentate gyrus discharged at gamma frequency and were phase-locked to the ascending part of the gamma waves recorded from the hilus. Following bilateral lesion of the entorhinal cortex the power and frequency of hilar gamma activity significantly decreased or disappeared. Instead, a large amplitude but slower gamma pattern (25–50 Hz) emerged in the {CA}3-{CA}1 network. We suggest that gamma oscillation emerges from an interaction between intrinsic oscillatory properties of interneurons and the network properties of the dentate gyrus. We also hypothesize that under physiological conditions the hilar gamma oscillation may be entrained by the entorhinal rhythm and that gamma oscillation in the {CA}3-{CA}1 circuitry is suppressed by either the hilar region or the entorhinal cortex.},

	abstract = {The role of immune or infective triggers in the pathogenesis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome ({CFS}) is not yet fully understood. Barriers to obtaining immune measures at baseline (i.e., before the trigger) in {CFS} and post-infective fatigue model cohorts have prevented the study of pre-existing immune dysfunction and subsequent immune changes in response to the trigger. This study presents interferon-alpha ({IFN}-α)-induced persistent fatigue as a model of {CFS}. {IFN}-α, which is used in the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C Virus ({HCV}) infection, induces a persistent fatigue in some individuals, which does not abate post-treatment, that is, once there is no longer immune activation. This model allows for the assessment of patients before and during exposure to the immune trigger, and afterwards when the original trigger is no longer present. Fifty-five patients undergoing {IFN}-α treatment for chronic {HCV} were assessed at baseline, during the 6–12 months of {IFN}-α treatment, and at six-months post-treatment. Measures of fatigue, cytokines and kynurenine pathway metabolites were obtained. Fifty-four {CFS} patients and 57 healthy volunteers completed the same measures at a one-off assessment, which were compared with post-treatment follow-up measures from the {HCV} patients. Eighteen patients undergoing {IFN}-α treatment (33\%) were subsequently defined as having ‘persistent fatigue’ (the proposed model for {CFS}), if their levels of fatigue were higher six-months post-treatment than at baseline; the other 67\% were considered ‘resolved fatigue’. Patients who went on to develop persistent fatigue experienced a greater increase in fatigue symptoms over the first four weeks of {IFN}-α, compared with patients who did not (Δ Treatment Week ({TW})-0 vs. {TW}4; {PF}: 7.1 ± 1.5 vs. {RF}: 4.0 ± 0.8, p = 0.046). Moreover, there was a trend towards increased baseline interleukin ({IL})-6, and significantly higher baseline {IL}-10 levels, as well as higher levels of these cytokines in response to {IFN}-α treatment, alongside concurrent increases in fatigue. Levels increased to more than double those of the other patients by Treatment Week ({TW})4 (p =  0.011 for {IL}-6 and p = 0.001 for {IL}-10). There was no evidence of an association between persistent fatigue and peripheral inflammation six-months post-treatment, nor did we observe peripheral inflammation in the {CFS} cohort. While there were changes in kynurenine metabolites in response to {IFN}-α, there was no association with persistent fatigue. {CFS} patients had lower levels of the ratio of kynurenine to tryptophan and 3-hydroxykynurenine than controls. Future studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms behind the initial exaggerated response of the immune system in those who go on to experience persistent fatigue even if the immune trigger is no longer present, and the change from acute to chronic fatigue in the absence of continued peripheral immune activation.},

Evidence from in vitro studies on nonneuronal cells in culture have shown that when fully activated by free radical-induced {DNA} damage, {PARP} depletes cellular {NAD}+ and consequently adenosine triphosphate ({ATP}) levels within a matter of minutes, and that this depletion is associated with a cell death that can be prevented by {PARP} inhibitors. The present in vivo study utilized the 1-methyl-4phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine ({MPTP})-treated mouse, a model of central nigrostriatal dopamine neurotoxicity that recapitulates certain features of Parkinson’s disease ({PD}), and one in which we have previously shown {PARP} inhibitors to be protective,6 to examine whether {MPTP} acutely caused regionand time-dependent changes in levels of {NAD}+ and {ATP} in the brain in vivo and whether such effects were modified by treatments with neuroprotective doses of the {PARP} inhibitor benzamide. The results confirm that {MPTP} reduces striatal {ATP} levels, as previously reported by Chan et al.,4 show that {MPTP} causes a regionally-selective (striatal and midbrain) loss of {NAD}+, and indicate that the {PARP} inhibitor benzamide can prevent these losses without interfering with {MPTP}-induced striatal dopamine release. These findings suggest an involvement of {PARP} in the control of brain energy metabolism during neurotoxic insult, provide further evidence in support of the participation of {PARP} in {MPTP}-induced neurotoxicity in vivo and suggest that {PARP} inhibitors might be beneficial in the treatment of {PD}.},

Derivation of intracellular {pH} ({pHi}) allowed calculation of ‘free’ {ADP} ({ADPf}) and ({AMPf}) concentrations. Changes in [K+]e were measured by an ion-sensitive microelectrode. The results showed that tissue {ATP} concentration, which was close to zero after 15 min of ischemia, rose to 30\% of control after 2 min, and to 60\% of control after 5 min of recirculation. However, since the adenine nucleotide pool was reduced by the ischemia the latter value represents extensive or complete phosphorylation of that pool, as reflected in a normalized {ATP}/{ADPf} ratio. During recirculation, the concentration of pyruvate rose, but the lactate content remained unchanged, suggesting that the substrate for oxidative metabolism was exogenous glucose. Resumption of Na+/K+ transport, as reflected in the [K+]e began after 2–3 min, and a normal [K+]e was attained within 5 min. The results demonstrate that transport of Na+ and K+ is resumed at tissue {ATP} concentrations which are only 30–40\% of control. It is discussed whether this reflects relatively extensive rephosphorylation of the remaining adenine nucleotide pool, or if compartmentation of adenine nucleotides exists during recirculation.},

	abstract = {After 15 min of severe ischemia induced by circumflex artery occlusion in open-chest dogs, 65\% of the {ATP} and 50\% of the total adenine nucleotide (ΣAd) pool is lost from the subendocardial myocardium [12]. Nevertheless, this injury is reversible if the affected tissue is reperfused with coronary arterial blood. In the present experiment, we assessed the effects of various periods of arterial reflow following 15 min of ischemic injury, on resynthesis of {ATP} and ΣAd. The circumflex artery was occluded for 15 min and reperfused for 20 or 60 min, or 24 or 96 h. Ten seconds prior to excision of the heart, the circumflex artery was reoccluded and the fluorescent dye thioflavine S was injected intravenously in order to identify the ischemic or the reperfused tissue which had been ischemic. The mean {ATP} after 15 min of ischemia was reduced 62\% from 5.42 ± 0.33 to 2.08 ± 0.21 μmol/g; and the total nucleotide content was reduced by 50\%. {ATP} content recovered slightly during the first 20 min of reperfusion but remained markedly depressed for at least 24 h because of the initial depletion of adenine nucleotides and because minimal salvage or de novo synthesis occurred in the injured muscle during this time period. By 4 days, {ATP} and total adenine nucleotides were still slightly depressed but had recovered to 88\% and 91\% of control. Electrolyte changes and an increased inulin diffusible space, which are characteristic of irreversibly injured myocardium reperfused for 20 or 60 min, were not observed. Also tissue necrosis was absent in the hearts reperfused for 24 or 96 h. These observations indicate that the marked depression of {ATP} and adenine nucleotides and the slow recovery of these metabolites occurred in myocardium which nevertheless was reversibly injured in terms of cellular viability.},

Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, {AK}2 {mRNA} and immune-positive cells were investigated during the entire epileptic process in pilocarpine-induced rat model of {TLE}. {AK}2 {mRNA} level was increased in rat hippocampus during different phases of the epileptogenesis, and reached a peak at 72 h. At 72 h time point, {AK}2 {mRNA} level was more than threefold comparing with the control. {AK}2-positive cells were observed in all regions of the hippocampus in model rats, but not in brain tissues of controls. The mean percentage of {AK}2-positive cells was increased as early as 6 h following seizure and reached a peak at 72 h. The pattern of {AK}2 expression over time was similar to that observed during neuronal apoptosis as detected with {TUNEL} staining.

The aim of the present study is to explore the expression pattern of {AK}5 in patients with refractory epilepsy and in a chronic pilocarpine-induced epileptic rat model. Using Western blot, immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation analysis, we found that {AK}5 protein was mainly expressed in neurons, demonstrated by colocalization with the dendritic marker, {MAP}2, which were similar to the corresponding controls. However, the expression of {AK}5 decreased remarkably in epileptic patients and experimental rats. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the interaction of {AK}5 with copine {VI} ({CPNE}6, a brain specific protein) increased in epileptic patients and rat models. Our results are the first to indicate that the expression of {AK}5 in epileptic brain tissue may play important roles in epilepsy, especially refractory epilepsy.},

To better understand how these cells repeatedly transit from a resting to active state without undergoing metabolic stress, we monitored their early metabolic response to neurotransmission using ion-sensitive probes and {FRET} sensors in vitro and in vivo. A short theta burst triggered immediate Na+ entry, followed by a delayed stimulation of the Na+/K+ {ATPase} pump. Unexpectedly, cytosolic {ATP} and {ADP} levels were unperturbed across a wide range of physiological workloads, revealing strict ﬂux coupling between the Na+ pump and mitochondria. Metabolic ﬂux measurements revealed a ‘‘priming’’ phase of mitochondrial energization by pyruvate, whereas glucose consumption coincided with delayed Na+ pump stimulation. Experiments revealed that the Na+ pump plays a permissive role for mitochondrial {ATP} production and glycolysis. We conclude that neuronal energy homeostasis is not mediated by adenine nucleotides or by Ca2+, but by a mechanism commanded by the Na+ pump.},

Our model integrates existing views of brain energy metabolism and is in accord with known macroscopic physiological changes in vivo.
Two-photon analysis of neural tissue shows that astrocytes feed glycolysis-generated lactate to neurons, which oxidize the lactate to supply energy for maintaining ionic balances.

Here, we develop a computational model to test whether this {AMPK}-mediated glucose import can rapidly restore {ATP} levels following a transient excitotoxic insult. We demonstrate that a highly compact model, comprising a minimal set of critical reactions, can closely resemble the rapid dynamics and cell-to-cell heterogeneity of {ATP} levels and {AMPK} activity, as confirmed by single-cell fluorescence microscopy in rat primary cerebellar neurons exposed to glutamate excitotoxicity. The model further correctly predicted an excitotoxicity-induced elevation of intracellular glucose, and well resembled the delayed recovery and cell-to-cell heterogeneity of experimentally measured glucose dynamics. The model also predicted necrotic bioenergetic collapse and altered calcium dynamics following more severe excitotoxic insults. In conclusion, our data suggest that a minimal set of critical reactions may determine the acute bioenergetic response to transient excitotoxicity and that an {AMPK}-mediated increase in intracellular glucose may be sufficient to rapidly recover {ATP} levels following an excitotoxic insult.},

	abstract = {Excitotoxicity is a condition occurring during cerebral ischemia, seizures, and chronic neurodegeneration. It is characterized by overactivation of glutamate receptors, leading to excessive Ca2+/Na+ influx into neurons, energetic stress, and subsequent neuronal injury. We and others have previously investigated neuronal populations to study how bioenergetic parameters determine neuronal injury; however, such experiments are often confounded by population-based heterogeneity and the contribution of effects of non-neuronal cells. Hence, we here characterized bioenergetics during transient excitotoxicity in rat and mouse primary neurons at the single-cell level using fluorescent sensors for intracellular glucose, {ATP}, and activation of the energy sensor {AMP}-activated protein kinase ({AMPK}). We identified {ATP} depletion and recovery to energetic homeostasis, along with {AMPK} activation, as surprisingly rapid and plastic responses in two excitotoxic injury paradigms. We observed rapid recovery of neuronal {ATP} levels also in the absence of extracellular glucose, or when glycolytic {ATP} production was inhibited, but found mitochondria to be critical for fast and complete energetic recovery. Using an injury model of oxygen and glucose deprivation, we identified a similarly rapid bioenergetics response, yet with incomplete {ATP} recovery and decreased {AMPK} activity. Interestingly, excitotoxicity also induced an accumulation of intracellular glucose, providing an additional source of energy during and after excitotoxicity-induced energy depletion. We identified this to originate from extracellular, {AMPK}-dependent glucose uptake and from intracellular glucose mobilization. Surprisingly, cells recovering their elevated glucose levels faster to baseline survived longer, indicating that the plasticity of neurons to adapt to bioenergetic challenges is a key indicator of neuronal viability.},

	abstract = {Sustained inward currents in neuronal membranes underlie tonic-clonic seizure discharges and spreading depression ({SD}). It is not known whether these currents flow through abnormally operating physiological ion channels or through pathological pathways that are not normally present. We have now used the {NEURON} simulating environment of Hines, Moore, and Carnevale to model seizure discharges and {SD}. The geometry and electrotonic properties of the model neuron conformed to a hippocampal pyramidal cell. Voltage-controlled transient and persistent sodium currents ({INa},T {andINa},P), potassium currents ({IK},{DR} and {IK},A), and N-methyl-d-aspartate ({NMDA}) receptor-controlled currents ({INMDA}), were inserted in the appropriate regions of the model cell. The neuron was surrounded by an interstitial space where extracellular potassium and sodium concentration ([K+]o and [Na+]o) could rise or fall. Changes in intra- and extracellular ion concentrations and the resulting shifts in the driving force for ionic currents were continuously computed based on the amount of current flowing through the membrane. A Na-K exchange pump operated to restore ion balances. In addition, extracellular potassium concentration, [K+]o, was also controlled by a “glial” uptake function. Parameters were chosen to resemble experimental data. As long as [K+]owas kept within limits by the activity of the Na-K pump and the “glial” uptake, a depolarizing current pulse applied to the cell soma evoked repetitive firing that ceased when the stimulating current stopped. If, however, [K+]o was allowed to rise, then a brief pulse provoked firing that outlasted the stimulus. At the termination of such a burst, the cell hyperpolarized and then slowly depolarized and another burst erupted without outside intervention. Such “clonic” bursting could continue indefinitely maintained by an interplay of the rise and fall of potassium and sodium concentrations with membrane currents and threshold levels. {SD}-like depolarization could be produced in two ways, 1) by a dendritic {NMDA}-controlled current. Glutamate was assumed to be released in response to rising [K+]o. And2) by the persistent (i.e., slowly inactivating) Na-current, {INa},P. When {bothINMDA} and {INa},Pwere present, the two acted synergistically. We conclude that epileptiform neuronal behavior and {SD}-like depolarization can be generated by the feedback of ion currents that change ion concentrations, which, in turn, influence ion currents and membrane potentials. The normal stability of brain function must depend on the efficient control of ion activities, especially that of [K+]o.},

	abstract = {We present a computational, biophysical model of neuron-astrocyte-vessel interaction. Unlike other cells, neurons convey “hunger” signals to the vascular network via an intervening layer of glial cells (astrocytes); vessels dilate and release glucose which fuels neuronal firing. Existing computational models focus on only parts of this loop (neuron→astrocyte→vessel→neuron), whereas the proposed model describes the entire loop. Neuronal firing causes release of a neurotransmitter like glutamate which triggers release of vasodilator by astrocytes via a cascade of biochemical events. Vasodilators released from astrocytic endfeet cause blood vessels to dilate and release glucose into the interstitium, part of which is taken up by the astrocyticendfeet. Glucose is converted into lactate in the astrocyte and transported into the neuron. Glucose from the interstitium and lactate (produced from glucose) influx from astrocyte are converted into {ATP} in the neuron. Neuronal {ATP} is used to drive the Na+/K+{ATPase} pumps, which maintain ionic gradients necessary for neuronal firing. When placed in the metabolic loop, the neuron exhibits sustained firing only when the stimulation current is more than a minimum threshold. For various combinations of initial neuronal [{ATP}] and external current, the neuron exhibits a variety of firing patterns including sustained firing, firing after an initial pause, burst firing etc. Neurovascular interactions under conditions of constricted vessels are also studied. Most models of cerebral circulation describe neurovascular interactions exclusively in the “forward” neuron→vessel direction. The proposed model indicates possibility of “reverse” influence also, with vasomotion rhythms influencing neural firing patterns. Another idea that emerges out of the proposed work is that brain's computations may be more comprehensively understood in terms of neuro-glial-vascular dynamics and not in terms of neural firing alone.},

Although these {MFEs} likely play a major role in the neuronal avalanches observed in culture and in vivo, the mechanisms underlying these {MFEs} cannot easily be captured using current population-dynamics models. In this work we introduce a coarse-grained framework which illustrates certain dynamics responsible for the generation of {MFEs}. By using a new kind of ensemble-average, this coarse-grained framework can not only address the nucleation of {MFEs}, but can also faithfully capture a broad range of dynamic regimes ranging from homogeneity to synchrony.},

After 3 kindled generalized tonic clonic seizures, there was 12.7\% neuronal loss in the hilar polymorphic region compared to controls, but there was no visually apparent lesion. After 30 generalized kindled seizures, the neuronal loss was 40.1\%, was visually apparent, and resembled one aspect of the pattern of hilar neuronal loss observed in human hippocampal sclerosis. The results demonstrate that brief sporadic seizures can induce neuronal loss in the hippocampal formation, a brain region implicated in epilepsy, memory, and cognition.},

	abstract = {Hippocampal theta oscillations are postulated to support mnemonic processes in humans and rodents. Theta oscillations facilitate encoding and spatial navigation, but to date, it has been difficult to dissociate the effects of volitional movement from the cognitive demands of a task. Therefore, we examined whether volitional movement or cognitive demands exerted a greater modulating factor over theta oscillations during decision-making. Given the anatomical, electrophysiological, and functional dissociations along the dorsal–ventral axis, theta oscillations were simultaneously recorded in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus in rats trained to switch between place and motor–response strategies.
Stark differences in theta characteristics were found between the dorsal and ventral hippocampus in frequency, power, and coherence. Theta power increased in the dorsal, but decreased in the ventral hippocampus, during the decision-making epoch. Interestingly, the relationship between running speed and theta power was uncoupled during the decision-making epoch, a phenomenon limited to the dorsal hippocampus. Theta frequency increased in both the dorsal and ventral hippocampus during the decision epoch, although this effect was greater in the dorsal hippocampus. Despite these differences, ventral hippocampal theta was responsive to the navigation task; theta frequency, power, and coherence were all affected by cognitive demands. Theta coherence increased within the dorsal hippocampus during the decision-making epoch on all three tasks. However, coherence selectively increased throughout the hippocampus (dorsal to ventral) on the task with new hippocampal learning. Interestingly, most results were consistent across tasks, regardless of hippocampal-dependent learning. These data indicate increased integration and cooperation throughout the hippocampus during information processing.},

	abstract = {Summary There is an extremely intimate relationship between sleep and epilepsy. In this manuscript I will review the influence that sleep has on epilepsy. Sleep is a potent activator of interictal epileptiform discharges. Sharp waves are infrequent during wakefulness in benign focal epilepsy of childhood, but may occur in runs of several discharges per page in sleep. The interictal discharges become almost continuous in non-{REM} sleep in the syndrome of encephalopathy with electrical status epilepticus during slow wave sleep. In some patients with West syndrome a hypsarrhythmia pattern may only appear in sleep whereas in others there may be an increase in discharges in a semiperiodic fashion resulting in a burst-suppression like pattern. Seizures appear to have a very close relationship with sleep in certain epilepsy syndromes. In benign focal epilepsy of childhood the seizures occur almost exclusively in sleep, while supplementary sensorimototor area seizures tend to occur in clusters during sleep. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy has a close relationship with the sleep-wake cycle with seizures tending to occur predominantly on awakening. I also discuss the role of sleep and sleep deprivation in the {EEG} evaluation of epilepsy.},

In the epileptic brain synchronization becomes pathological thus generating seizures and several kinds of interictal activity as well as fast ripples ({\textgreater}250 Hz). Here, we outline the contributions made to seizure initiation, synchronization and termination by: (i) glutamatergic and {GABAergic} (including depolarizing {GABAergic}) synaptic transmission, (ii) non-synaptic mechanisms including ephaptic interactions, gap junctions and extracellular ions (particularly potassium), and (iii) glial homeostasis and transmission. We also consider the specific roles played by various components of the limbic circuit in seizure generation; for instance the ability of the hippocampal {CA}3 area to control seizure occurrence in others (such as entorhinal cortex) by generating interictal discharges. Finally we discuss whether targeting synchrony by electrical stimulation may be a potential therapeutic target.},

	abstract = {Since the formal characterization of sleep stages, there have been reports that seizures may preferentially occur in certain phases of sleep. Through ascending cholinergic connections from the brainstem, rapid eye movement ({REM}) sleep is physiologically characterized by low voltage fast activity on the electroencephalogram, {REMs}, and muscle atonia. Multiple independent studies confirm that, in {REM} sleep, there is a strikingly low proportion of seizures ({\textasciitilde}1\% or less). We review a total of 42 distinct conventional and intracranial studies in the literature which comprised a net of 1458 patients. Indexed to duration, we found that {REM} sleep was the most protective stage of sleep against focal seizures, generalized seizures, focal interictal discharges, and two particular epilepsy syndromes. {REM} sleep had an additional protective effect compared to wakefulness with an average 7.83 times fewer focal seizures, 3.25 times fewer generalized seizures, and 1.11 times fewer focal interictal discharges. In further studies {REM} sleep has also demonstrated utility in localizing epileptogenic foci with potential translation into postsurgical seizure freedom. Based on emerging connectivity data in sleep, we hypothesize that the influence of {REM} sleep on seizures is due to a desynchronized {EEG} pattern which reflects important connectivity differences unique to this sleep stage.},

M1 receptor activation depolarizes pyramidal neurons by increasing the mixed Na+/K+ current Ih and the Ca2+-dependent nonspecific cation current Icat, but not by modulation of {IM}.

Superoxide is produced at complexes I and {III} of the {ETC}, starting a complex network of {ROS} reactions. To achieve a deeper mechanistic understanding of how {ROS} are generated by complex {III}, we developed a mathematical model that successfully describes experimental data of complex {III} activity in various rat tissues, the production of {ROS} with and without antimycin and {ROS} generation depending on different values of the membrane potential ∆Ψ. The model also reinforces the idea of ubiquinone acting as a redox mediator between heme {bL} and oxygen, as proposed earlier.},

	abstract = {Observations on the relationship between cardiac work rate and the levels of energy metabolites adenosine triphosphate ({ATP}), adenosine diphosphate ({ADP}), and phosphocreatine ({CrP}) have not been satisfactorily explained by theoretical models of cardiac energy metabolism. Specifically, the in vivo stability of {ATP}, {ADP}, and {CrP} levels in response to changes in work and respiratory rate has eluded explanation. Here a previously developed model of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, which was developed based on data obtained from isolated cardiac mitochondria, is integrated with a spatially distributed model of oxygen transport in the myocardium to analyze data obtained from several laboratories over the past two decades. The model includes the components of the respiratory chain, the F0F1-{ATPase}, adenine nucleotide translocase, and the mitochondrial phosphate transporter at the mitochondrial level; adenylate kinase, creatine kinase, and {ATP} consumption in the cytoplasm; and oxygen transport between capillaries, interstitial fluid, and cardiomyocytes. The integrated model is able to reproduce experimental observations on {ATP}, {ADP}, {CrP}, and inorganic phosphate levels in canine hearts over a range of workload and during coronary hypoperfusion and predicts that cytoplasmic inorganic phosphate level is a key regulator of the rate of mitochondrial respiration at workloads for which the rate of cardiac oxygen consumption is less than or equal to approximately 12 μmol per minute per gram of tissue. At work rates corresponding to oxygen consumption higher than 12 μmol min−1 g−1, model predictions deviate from the experimental data, indicating that at high work rates, additional regulatory mechanisms that are not currently incorporated into the model may be important. Nevertheless, the integrated model explains metabolite levels observed at low to moderate workloads and the changes in metabolite levels and tissue oxygenation observed during graded hypoperfusion. These findings suggest that the observed stability of energy metabolites emerges as a property of a properly constructed model of cardiac substrate transport and mitochondrial metabolism. In addition, the validated model provides quantitative predictions of changes in phosphate metabolites during cardiac ischemia.},

(1989) Studia Biophys. 132, 173–187) simulates concentration changes in time of chemical compounds and thermodynamic forces during respiration of cell suspension in a closed chamber. A set of differential equations solved numerically describes the utilization of oxygen up to anaerobiosis and the behaviour of the system after a sudden pulse of oxygen. Flux control coefficients for most important reactions (enzymes) of oxidative phosphorylation were calculated. A good qualitative and (when a direct comparison is possible) quantitative agreement with experimental results can be observed. The following conclusions can be drawn from the simulation: (1) Wilson's steady state model is not in contradiction with sharing of the control over the respiration between some steps and displacement of the {ATP}/{ADP} carrier from equilibrium. (2) The overshoot characteristics of the Δμ˜H+ time-course after reoxygenation can be explained without using the lag-phase kinetics of {ATP}-synthetase. (3) A ‘hot region’ (sharp changes of many parameters) can be distinguished when the oxygen concentration approaches zero; only cytochrome oxidase is clearly sensitive on oxygen concentration in all its range. (4) Control over oxidative phosphorylation is shared mainly between inputs of the system ({ATP} utilization and substrate dehydrogenation) and the proton leak.},

Using electrophysiology, we found that one of our new compounds, {AzoCholine}, is an excellent photoswitchable agonist for neuronal α7 {nAChRs}, whereas {BisQ} was confirmed to be an agonist for the muscle-type {nAChR}. {AzoCholine} could be used to modulate cholinergic activity in a brain slice and in dorsal root ganglion neurons. In addition, we demonstrate light-dependent perturbation of behavior in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans.},

	abstract = {We follow up on a suggestion by Rolls and co-workers, that the effects of competitive learning should be assessed on the shape and number of spatial fields that dentate gyrus ({DG}) granule cells may form when receiving input from medial entorhinal cortex ({mEC}) grid units. We consider a simple non-dynamical model where {DG} units are described by a threshold-linear transfer function, and receive feedforward inputs from 1,000 {mEC} model grid units of various spacing, orientation and spatial phase. Feedforward weights are updated according to a Hebbian rule as the virtual rodent follows a long simulated trajectory through a single environment. Dentate activity is constrained to be very sparse. We find that indeed competitive Hebbian learning tends to result in a few active {DG} units with a single place field each, rounded in shape and made larger by iterative weight changes. These effects are more pronounced when produced with thousands of {DG} units and inputs per {DG} unit, which the realistic system has available, than with fewer units and inputs, in which case several {DG} units persists with multiple fields. The emergence of single-field units with learning is in contrast, however, to recent data indicating that most active {DG} units do have multiple fields. We show how multiple irregularly arranged fields can be produced by the addition of non-space selective lateral entorhinal cortex ({lEC}) units, which are modelled as simply providing an additional effective input specific to each {DG} unit. The mean number of such multiple {DG} fields is enhanced, in particular, when {lEC} and {mEC} inputs have overall similar variance across {DG} units. Finally, we show that in a restricted environment the mean size of the fields is unaltered, while their mean number is scaled down with the area of the environment.},

We further propose that mind-travel occurs during the second half of each theta cycle. By contrast, the first half of each theta cycle is devoted to computing current position using sensory information from the lateral entorhinal cortex ({LEC}) and path integration information from the medial entorhinal cortex ({MEC}).

Firing rates of some neurons were phasically selective for conditioned stimuli in a way that depended on which room the rat was in; nearly all neurons were tonically selective for environments in a way that depended on which stimuli had been presented in those environments. As rats moved from one environment to another, tonic neuron ensemble activity exhibited prospective information about the conditioned stimulus associated with the environment. Thus, the {LEC} formed phasic and tonic codes for event-environment associations, thereby accurately differentiating multiple experiences with overlapping features.},

	abstract = {Summary
Although hippocampal {CA}1 pyramidal neurons ({PNs}) were thought to comprise a uniform population, recent evidence supports two distinct sublayers along the radial axis, with deep neurons more likely to form place cells than superficial neurons. {CA}1 {PNs} also differ along the transverse axis with regard to direct inputs from entorhinal cortex ({EC}), with medial {EC} ({MEC}) providing spatial information to {PNs} toward {CA}2 (proximal {CA}1) and lateral {EC} ({LEC}) providing non-spatial information to {PNs} toward subiculum (distal {CA}1). We demonstrate that the two inputs differentially activate the radial sublayers and that this difference reverses along the transverse axis, with {MEC} preferentially targeting deep {PNs} in proximal {CA}1 and {LEC} preferentially exciting superficial {PNs} in distal {CA}1. This differential excitation reflects differences in dendritic spine numbers. Our results reveal a heterogeneity in {EC}-{CA}1 connectivity that may help explain differential roles of {CA}1 {PNs} in spatial and non-spatial learning and memory.},

Although the spatial signal may reflect input from medial entorhinal cortex, the sources of the variations in firing rate have not been identified. We found that rate variations in rat {CA}3 place cells depended on inputs from the lateral entorhinal cortex ({LEC}). Hippocampal rate remapping, induced by changing the shape or the color configuration of the environment, was impaired by lesions in those parts of the ipsilateral {LEC} that provided the densest input to the hippocampal recording position. Rate remapping was not observed in {LEC} itself. The findings suggest that {LEC} inputs are important for efficient rate coding in the hippocampus.},

The hippocampus receives cortical input from two major pathways: the medial entorhinal cortex ({MEC}) and the lateral entorhinal cortex ({LEC}). During exploration in an open field, the firing fields of {MEC} grid cells form a periodically repeating, triangular array. In contrast, {LEC} neurons show little spatial selectivity, and it has been proposed that the {LEC} may provide nonspatial input to the hippocampus. Here, we recorded {MEC} and {LEC} neurons while rats explored an open field that contained discrete objects. {LEC} cells fired selectively at locations relative to the objects, whereas {MEC} cells were weakly influenced by the objects. These results provide the first direct demonstration of a double dissociation between {LEC} and {MEC} inputs to the hippocampus under conditions of exploration typically used to study hippocampal place cells.},

	abstract = {Successful spatial navigation is thought to employ a combination of at least two strategies: the following of landmark cues and path integration. Path integration requires that the brain use the speed and direction of movement in a meaningful way to continuously compute the position of the animal. Indeed, the running speed of rats modulates both the firing rate of neurons and the spectral properties of low frequency, theta oscillations seen in the local field potential ({LFP}) of the hippocampus, a region important for spatial memory formation. Higher frequency, gamma-band {LFP} oscillations are usually associated with decision-making, increased attention, and improved reaction times. Here, we show that increased running speed is accompanied by large, systematic increases in the frequency of hippocampal {CA}1 network oscillations spanning the entire gamma range (30–120 Hz) and beyond. These speed-dependent changes in frequency are seen on both linear tracks and two-dimensional platforms, and are thus independent of the behavioral task. Synchrony between anatomically distant {CA}1 regions also shifts to higher gamma frequencies as running speed increases. The changes in frequency are strongly correlated with changes in the firing rates of individual interneurons, consistent with models of gamma generation. Our results suggest that as a rat runs faster, there are faster gamma frequency transitions between sequential place cell-assemblies. This may help to preserve the spatial specificity of place cells and spatial memories at vastly different running speeds.},

	abstract = {Medial entorhinal cortex ({MEC}) grid cells exhibit firing fields spread across the environment on the vertices of a regular tessellating triangular grid. In rodents, the size of the firing fields and the spacing between the firing fields are topographically organized such that grid cells located more ventrally in {MEC} exhibit larger grid fields and larger grid-field spacing compared with grid cells located more dorsally. Previous experiments in brain slices from rodents have shown that several intrinsic cellular electrophysiological properties of stellate cells in layer {II} of {MEC} change systematically in neurons positioned along the dorsal-ventral axis of {MEC}, suggesting that these intrinsic cellular properties might control grid-field spacing. In the bat, grid cells in {MEC} display a functional topography in terms of grid-field spacing, similar to what has been reported in rodents. However, it is unclear whether neurons in bat {MEC} exhibit similar gradients of cellular physiological properties, which may serve as a conserved mechanism underlying grid-field spacing in mammals. To test whether entorhinal cortex ({EC}) neurons in rats and bats exhibit similar electrophysiological gradients, we performed whole-cell patch recordings along the dorsal-ventral axis of {EC} in bats. Surprisingly, our data demonstrate that the sag response properties and the resonance properties recorded in layer {II} neurons of entorhinal cortex in the Egyptian fruit bat demonstrate an inverse relationship along the dorsal-ventral axis compared with the rat.
{SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT}: As animals navigate, neurons in medial entorhinal cortex ({MEC}), termed grid cells, discharge at regular spatial intervals. In bats and rats, the spacing between the firing fields of grid cells changes systematically along the dorsal-ventral axis of {MEC}. It has been proposed that these changes could be generated by systematic differences in the intrinsic cellular physiology of neurons distributed along the dorsal-ventral axis of {MEC}. The results from our study show that key intrinsic physiological properties of neurons in entorhinal cortex of the bat and rat change in the opposite direction along the dorsal-ventral axis of entorhinal cortex, suggesting that these intrinsic physiological properties cannot account in the same way across species for the change in grid-field spacing shown along the dorsal-ventral axis.},

Although it has been shown that acute manipulations of {mEC} ﬁring patterns are sufﬁcient for inducing hippocampal remapping, it remains unknown whether specialized spatial {mEC} inputs are necessary for the reorganization of hippocampal spatial representations. Here, we examined remapping in rats without {mEC} input to the hippocampus and found that highly distinct spatial maps emerged rapidly in every individual rat.

We refer to these cells as nongrid spatial cells and conﬁrmed that their spatial ﬁring patterns were unrelated to running speed and highly reproducible within the same environment. However, in response to manipulations of environmental features, such as box shape or box color, nongrid spatial cells completely reorganized their spatial ﬁring patterns. At the same time, grid cells retained their spatial alignment and predominantly responded with redistributed ﬁring rates across their grid ﬁelds.

	abstract = {The septal {GABAergic} system plays a central role in the regulation of activity and excitability of the hippocampus (the main locus of temporal lobe epilepsy, {TLE}), but the character of changes the septum undergoes in this pathology remains unknown. To address this issue we studied the influences on {GABAergic} receptors in septal slices from the brain of epileptic guinea pigs compared to a control. In the epileptic brain, the overall increase in the mean frequency of neuronal discharges and the rise in the number of bursting neurons were revealed. The inhibitory action of exogenously applied {GABA} on neuronal activity is sharply enhanced, whereas the efficacy of action of {GABA}(A) and {GABA}(B) receptor blockers decreases, indicating the alteration of intraseptal inhibitory processes in epilepsy. In epilepsy, {GABA} sharply increases the oscillatory activity of the part of pacemakers, and the opposite effect was observed in the control. In epileptic animals, the {GABA} receptor blockers did not affect burst neurons, indicating the disturbance of the tonic {GABAergic} control of the oscillatory activity. Thus, we demonstrated for the first time that the activity of septal neurons and their reactions to {GABAergic} substances in animals with {TLE} model changed sharply compared to healthy ones.},

Our data demonstrate that in sparse cultures, microelectrodes record exclusively from cells which reside at very close proximity to the recording electrode. Moreover, we show that recording appears to be limited to only a partial subset of the cells residing in this range. We further show that even in cases of strong neuron-electrode coupling, extra-cellular signals recorded from single, well-identified neurons vary in shape over time rendering spike sorting and network activity rate analysis incongruous.

In this study, {MS}-{DB} neurons recorded in urethane anesthetized rats and in unanesthetized restrained rats were labeled with neurobiotin and processed for immunohistochemistry against glutamic acid decarboxylase ({GAD}), parvalbumin ({PV}), and choline acetyltransferase ({ChAT}). The majority of the 90 labeled neurons (75.5\%) were {GAD}+. Among them, 34.0\% were also {PV}+, but none were {ChAT}+. Only 8.8\% of the labeled neurons were found {ChAT}+. Remaining neurons (15.5\%) were not identified. In anesthetized rats, all of the {PV}/{GAD}+ and 65\% of {GAD}+ neurons exhibited burst-firing activity at the theta frequency. {PV}/{GAD}+ neurons displayed higher discharge rate and longer burst duration compared with {GAD}+ neurons. At variance, all of the {ChAT}+ neurons were slow-firing. Cluster-firing and tonic-firing were observed in {GAD}+ and unidentified neurons. In unanesthetized rats, during wakefulness or rapid eye movement sleep with hippocampal theta, the bursting neurons were {PV}/{GAD}+ or {GAD}+, whereas all of the {ChAT}+ neurons were slow-firing. Across the sleep-wake cycle, the {GABAergic} component of the septohippocampal pathway was always more active than the cholinergic one. The fact that cholinergic {MS}-{DB} neurons do not display theta-related bursting or tonic activity but have a very low firing rate questions how acetylcholine exerts its activating role in the septohippocampal system.},

Galantamine shows a dual action profile by also acting as an allosteric modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Nevertheless, its in vivo mechanism of action is only partly understood. Here, we first established a novel lesion model provoking significant functional impairment of the septo-hippocampal projection system without triggering massive neuronal death in the rat medial septum. Next, we studied whether galantamine, administered in doses of 1 and 3mg/kg post-lesion, promotes functional recovery of spatial navigation behaviors, and affects the output of septal cholinergic projections. Infusion of N-methyl-d-aspartate ({NMDA}; 30nmol/1microl) in the medial septum resulted in spatial learning deficits associated with significant shrinkage of cholinergic neurons and reduced {AChE} activity in the hippocampus at 7 days post-lesion. Galantamine treatment alone significantly increased the hippocampal acetylcholine concentration and attenuated the {NMDA}-induced spatial learning impairment. Galantamine post-treatment also affected {NMDA}-induced changes in {AChE} and choline-acetyltransferase activities. In conclusion, our data show that galantamine attenuates experimentally-induced cognitive impairments underscored by mild neuronal damage.},

	abstract = {Seizures in patients presenting with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy result from the interaction among neuronal networks in limbic structures such as the hippocampus, amygdala and entorhinal cortex. Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, one of the most common forms of partial epilepsy in adulthood, is generally accompanied by a pattern of brain damage known as mesial temporal sclerosis. Limbic seizures can be mimicked in vitro using preparations of combined hippocampus-entorhinal cortex slices perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing convulsants or nominally zero Mg(2+), in order to produce epileptiform synchronization. Here, we summarize experimental evidence obtained in such slices from rodents. These data indicate that in control animals: (i) prolonged, {NMDA} receptor-dependent epileptiform discharges, resembling electrographic limbic seizures, originate in the entorhinal cortex from where they propagate to the hippocampus via the perforant path-dentate gyrus route; (ii) the initiation and maintenance of these ictal discharges is paradoxically contributed by {GABA} (mainly type A) receptor-mediated mechanisms; and (iii) {CA}3 outputs, which relay a continuous pattern of interictal discharge at approximately 1Hz, control rather than sustain ictal discharge generation in entorhinal cortex. Recent work indicates that such a control is weakened in the pilocarpine model of epilepsy (presumably as a result of {CA}3 cell damage). In addition, in these experiments electrographic seizure activity spreads directly to the {CA}1-subiculum regions through the temporoammonic pathway. Studies reviewed here indicate that these changes in network interactions, along with other mechanisms of synaptic plasticity (e.g. axonal sprouting, decreased activation of interneurons, upregulation of bursting neurons) can confer to the epileptic, damaged limbic system, the ability to produce recurrent limbic seizures as seen in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.},

A mutation of the gamma2 subunit of the {GABA}(A) receptor, which substitutes glutamine for arginine at position 43 (R43Q) has been found in a familial generalized epilepsy. We tested the hypothesis that individuals affected by the {GABRG}2(R43Q) mutation have reduced binding to the {GABA}(A) receptor complex using positron emission tomography ({PET}) and the benzodiazepine receptor ligand [(11)C]-flumazenil. Fourteen subjects with the {GABRG}2(R43Q) mutation and 20 controls were studied. Benzodiazepine receptor binding was reduced in subjects with the mutation (mean whole brain binding potential for [(11)C]-flumazenil: {GABA}(A) mutation 0.66+/-0.1; controls 0.89+/-0.1; P{\textless}0.003). The greatest change in benzodiazepine binding occurred anteriorly, with peak differences in insular and anterior cingulate cortices revealed by statistical parametric mapping. Our findings provide in vivo evidence of reduced benzodiazepine receptor binding in subjects with the mutation. As synaptic inhibition in the human brain is largely mediated by the {GABA}(A) receptor, these findings are likely to represent an important clue to the mechanisms linking this gene defect and the epilepsy phenotype.},

We investigated rapid changes in glutamate release in the {PH}-{TMN} across the sleep-wake cycle with a glutamate biosensor that allows the measurement of glutamate levels at 1- to 4-s resolution. In the {PH}-{TMN}, glutamate levels increased in active waking ({AW}) and rapid eye movement ({REM}) sleep compared with quiet waking and nonrapid eye movement ({NREM}) sleep. There was a rapid (0.6 +/- 1.8 s) and progressive increase in glutamate levels at {REM} sleep onset. A reduction in glutamate levels consistently preceded the offset of {REM} sleep by 8 +/- 3 s. Short-duration sleep deprivation resulted in a progressive increase in glutamate levels in the {PH}-{TMN}, perifornical-lateral hypothalamus ({PF}-{LH}), and cortex. We found that in the {PF}-{LH}, glutamate levels took a longer time to return to basal values compared with the time it took for glutamate levels to increase to peak values during {AW} onset. This is in contrast to other regions we studied in which the return to baseline values after {AW} was quicker than their rise with waking onset. In summary, we demonstrated an increase in glutamate levels in the {PH}-{TMN} with {REM}/{AW} onset and a drop in glutamate levels before the offset of {REM}. High temporal resolution measurement of glutamate levels reveals dynamic changes in release linked to the initiation and termination of {REM} sleep.},

My experience as an intern (anno 1953) treating a youngster in diabetic ketoacidosis underscored our ignorance of the controls in human fuel metabolism. Circulating free fatty acids were then unknown, insulin could not be measured in biologic fluids, and beta-hydroxybutyric acid, which was difficult to measure, was considered by many a metabolic poison. The central role of insulin and the metabolism of free fatty acids, glycerol, glucose, lactate, and pyruvate, combined with indirect calorimetry, needed characterization in a near-steady state, namely prolonged starvation. This is the main topic of this chapter. Due to its use by brain, D-beta-hydroxybutyric acid not only has permitted man to survive prolonged starvation, but also may have therapeutic potential owing to its greater efficiency in providing cellular energy in ischemic states such as stroke, myocardial insufficiency, neonatal stress, genetic mitochondrial problems, and physical fatigue.},

Metabolic control theory applies principles of bioenergetics and genome flexibility to the management of complex phenotypic traits. Epilepsy is a complex brain disorder involving excessive, synchronous, abnormal electrical firing patterns of neurons. We propose that many epilepsies with varied etiologies may ultimately involve disruptions of brain energy homeostasis and are potentially manageable through principles of metabolic control theory. This control involves moderate shifts in the availability of brain energy metabolites (glucose and ketone bodies) that alter energy metabolism through glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, respectively. These shifts produce adjustments in gene-linked metabolic networks that manage or control the seizure disorder despite the continued presence of the inherited or acquired factors responsible for the epilepsy. This hypothesis is supported by information on the management of seizures with diets including fasting, the ketogenic diet and caloric restriction. A better understanding of the compensatory genetic and neurochemical networks of brain energy metabolism may produce novel antiepileptic therapies that are more effective and biologically friendly than those currently available.},

Stress and adaptation to stress require numerous homeostatic adjustments including hormones, neurotransmitters, oxidants, and other mediators. The stress-induced hormones, neurotransmitters, and oxidants all have beneficial, but also harmful effects if out of balance. Therefore, the homeostasis of stress and adaptation should be governed by the hormone balance, neurotransmitter balance, and oxidant balance, as well as the interactions among these substances. The imbalance and the over-interaction of these balances may ultimately cause increased oxidant generation and oxidative damage to biomolecules. This increased oxidative damage may add to the oxidant burden associated with normal aerobic metabolism, which in itself, generates oxidants, causes accumulation of oxidative damage in mitochondria, and contributes to normal aging. Therefore, the stress-associated increase of oxidative damage may, in part, contribute to stress-associated aging acceleration and age-related neurodegenerative diseases.},

	abstract = {Neurogranin (Ng) (also named {RC}3, p17 or {BICKS}) is a small protein originally identified in rat brain and abundantly expressed in several telencephalic areas, such as the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and striatum. In neurons, it is found concentrated at dendritic spines where it participates in synaptic signaling events through the regulation of calmodulin ({CaM}) availability. Ng features an {IQ} motif that mediates its interaction with {CaM} and phosphatidic acid ({PA}) and that is phosphorylated by protein kinase C ({PKC}) at serine 36 (Ser36). Ser36-phosphorylated Ng is unable to bind either {CaM} or {PA}. Ng knockout mice display an apparently normal phenotype; however, they show severe deficits in spatial and emotional learning and a decrease in {LTP} induction, mostly due to the attenuation of the signaling that depends on calcium/{CaM} kinase {II} ({CaMKII}), {PKC}, and protein kinase A ({PKA}) activation. The present review is an update on the most relevant information about Ng expression, localization, interactions, and modifications as well as on its role in synaptic plasticity. © 2010 {IUBMB} {IUBMB} Life, 62(8): 594–606, 2010.},

In particular, substantial progress has been made in elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation and plasticity of {GABAergic} synapses. Evidence available ascribes a key role to the cytoplasmic protein gephyrin to form a postsynaptic scaffold anchoring {GABA} A receptors along with other transmembrane proteins and signaling molecules in the postsynaptic density. However, the mechanisms of gephyrin scaffolding remain elusive, notably because gephyrin can auto-aggregate spontaneously and lacks {PDZ} protein interaction domains found in a majority of scaffolding proteins. In addition, the structural diversity of {GABA} A receptors, which are pentameric channels encoded by a large family of subunits, has been largely overlooked in these studies. Finally, the role of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, present in a subset of {GABAergic} synapses in cortical structures, remains ill-defined. In this review, we discuss recent results derived mainly from the analysis of mutant mice lacking a specific {GABA} A receptor subtype or a core protein of the {GABAergic} postsynaptic density (neuroligin-2, collybistin), highlighting the molecular diversity of {GABAergic} synapses and its relevance for brain plasticity and function.

An imbalance in these synapses may lead to various neurological disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, Tourette’s syndrome and epilepsy. Synapses are formed through communication between the appropriate synaptic partners. However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate the formation of specific synaptic types are not known. Here we show that two members of the fibroblast growth factor ({FGF}) family, {FGF}22 and {FGF}7, promote the organization of excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic terminals, respectively, as target-derived presynaptic organizers. {FGF}22 and {FGF}7 are expressed by {CA}3 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus. The differentiation of excitatory or inhibitory nerve terminals on dendrites of {CA}3 pyramidal neurons is specifically impaired in mutants lacking {FGF}22 or {FGF}7. These presynaptic defects are rescued by postsynaptic expression of the appropriate {FGF}. {FGF}22-deficient mice are resistant to epileptic seizures, and {FGF}7-deficient mice are prone to them, as expected from the alterations in excitatory/inhibitory balance. Differential effects of {FGF}22 and {FGF}7 involve both their distinct synaptic localizations and their use of different signalling pathways. These results demonstrate that specific {FGFs} act as target-derived presynaptic organizers and help to organize specific presynaptic terminals in the mammalian brain.},

Recent progress in the study on regulation mechanism of {RP} is reported. {RP} is induced by depolarization of a Purkinje cell and expressed as the increased postsynaptic responsiveness to {GABA}. {RP} might work as a homeostatic mechanism to maintain activity of a Purkinje cell sensing the strength of heterosynaptic excitatory inputs.

The ensuing quest for the mechanisms of d-serine synthesis, release and clearance, as well as for its physiological significance has provided a wealth of experimental evidence implicating d-serine in synaptic plasticity. However some key questions remain unanswered. Which cells release d-serine and upon what stimuli? Is d-serine supply dynamically regulated? What is the fate of released d-serine? Answering these questions appears to be an essential step in our understanding of how {NMDARs} trigger synaptic plasticity and learning.

	abstract = {The activity-dependent neuronal modification is important for many aspects of adaptive behavior and brain development. Very often, neurological disorders are associated with the alteration of neural signaling pathways that are required for activity-triggered cellular events. Mounting evidence has implicated the role of cyclic {AMP} ({cAMP})-{cAMP}-dependent protein kinase ({PKA})-{ERK}1/2-{cAMP}-responsive element-binding protein ({CREB}) cascade in numerous brain functions such as learning and memory. Ca2+-stimulated type 1 and type 8 adenylyl cyclases ({AC}1 and {AC}8) are unique enzymes that couple activity-dependent calcium influx to the activation of {cAMP} signaling. Here, we summarize some direct evidence to support that Ca2+-stimulated {cAMP} signaling regulates molecular and cellular substrates of neuronal adaptation. Specifically, the function of {AC}1 and {AC}8 in synaptic functions, such as long-term potentiation, long-term depression, and depotentiation, has been examined by using genetic deletion and overexpression approaches. Consistent with the current hypothesis, the Ca2+-stimulated {cAMP} production through {AC}1 and {AC}8 is required for the activity-dependent activation of the {ERK}1/2-{CREB} cascade. We further describe the phenotypes of {AC}1/{AC}8 mutant mice in memory formation and other adaptive brain functions. The findings may suggest Ca2+-stimulated {AC} as therapeutic target for the treatment of mental retardation, pain, addiction, anxiety, depression, and neurodegeneration.},

This plasticity allows behavior to be accommodated to the environment, providing an important evolutionary advantage. Neurons convert environmental stimuli into long-lasting changes in their physiology in part through the synaptic activity-regulated transcription of new gene products. Since the neurotransmitter-dependent regulation of Fos transcription was first discovered nearly 25 years ago, a wealth of studies have enriched our understanding of the molecular pathways that mediate activity-regulated changes in gene transcription. These findings show that a broad range of signaling pathways and transcriptional regulators can be engaged by neuronal activity to sculpt complex programs of stimulus-regulated gene transcription. However, the shear scope of the transcriptional pathways engaged by neuronal activity raises the question of how specificity in the nature of the transcriptional response is achieved in order to encode physiologically relevant responses to divergent stimuli. Here we summarize the general paradigms by which neuronal activity regulates transcription while focusing on the molecular mechanisms that confer differential stimulus-, cell-type-, and developmental-specificity upon activity-regulated programs of neuronal gene transcription. In addition, we preview some of the new technologies that will advance our future understanding of the mechanisms and consequences of activity-regulated gene transcription in the brain.},

With recognition of its roles in synaptic plasticity (long-term potentiation, {LTP}; long-term depression, {LTD}) and elucidation of calcium-dependent, {NMDAR}-mediated activation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase ({nNOS}), numerous molecular and pharmacological tools have been used to explore the physiology and pathological consequences for nitrergic signaling. In this review, the authors summarize the current understanding of this subtle signaling pathway, discuss the evidence for nitrergic modulation of ion channels and homeostatic modulation of intrinsic excitability, and speculate about the pathological consequences of spillover between different nitrergic compartments in contributing to aberrant signaling in neurodegenerative disorders. Accumulating evidence points to various ion channels and particularly voltage-gated potassium channels as signaling targets, whereby {NO} mediates activity-dependent control of intrinsic neuronal excitability; such changes could underlie broader mechanisms of synaptic plasticity across neuronal networks. In addition, the inability to constrain {NO} diffusion suggests that spillover from endothelium ({eNOS}) and/or immune compartments ({iNOS}) into the nervous system provides potential pathological sources of {NO} and where control failure in these other systems could have broader neurological implications. Abnormal {NO} signaling could therefore contribute to a variety of neurodegenerative pathologies such as stroke/excitotoxicity, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease.},

	abstract = {Long-term potentiation ({LTP}) defines persistent increases in neurotransmission strength at synapses that are triggered by specific patterns of neuronal activity. {LTP}, the most widely accepted molecular model for learning, is best characterised at glutamatergic synapses on dendritic spines. In this context, {LTP} involves increases in dendritic spine size and the insertion of glutamate receptors into the post-synaptic spine membrane, which together boost post-synaptic responsiveness to neurotransmitters. In dendrites, the material required for {LTP} is sourced from an organelle termed the endosomal-recycling compartment ({ERC}), which is localised to the base of dendritic spines. When {LTP} is induced, material derived from the recycling compartment, which contains α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate-type glutamate receptors ({AMPARs}), is mobilised into dendritic spines feeding the increased need for receptors and membrane at the spine neck and head. In this review, we discuss the importance of endosomal-recycling and the role of key proteins which control these processes in the context of {LTP}.},

In addition, here we report the spontaneous transformation of resorufin to less or nonfluorescent product(s) in the absence of hydrogen peroxide and horseradish peroxidase. This spontaneous decay of resorufin fluorescence is most prominent in the {pH} range 6.2-7.7, likely due to general base-catalyzed de-N-acetylation and polymerization of resorufin.

Astrocytes, in particular, play a critical and complex role in synapse development, maintenance, and plasticity. Likewise, neurons reciprocally influence astrocyte physiology. However, the molecular signaling events that enable astrocytes and neurons to effectively communicate with each other are only partially defined. Recent findings have revealed that Eph receptor tyrosine kinases and ephrins play an important role in contact-dependent neuron–glia communication at synapses. Upon binding, these two families of cell surface-associated proteins trigger bidirectional signaling events that regulate the structural and physiological properties of both neurons and astrocytes. This review will focus on the emerging role of Eph receptors and ephrins in neuron–astrocyte interaction at synapses and discuss implications for synaptic plasticity, behavior, and disease. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The electric activity of the trisynaptic pathway is controlled mainly by different types of local, {GABAergic} interneurons, and subcortical and commissural afferents. In this chapter we will outline the origin and postsynaptic targets in the dentate gyrus of chemically identified subcortical inputs. These systems are afferents originating from the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca {GABAergic} and cholinergic neurons, neurochemically distinct types of neurons located in the supramammillary area, serotonergic fibers from the median raphe, noradrenergic afferents from the pontine nucleus, locus ceruleus, dopamine axons originating in the ventral tegmental area, and the commissural projection system. Because of the physiological implications, these afferents are discussed in the context of the glutamatergic innervation of the dentate gyrus. One common feature of the extrinsic dentate afferent systems is that they originate from a relatively small number of neurons. However, the majority of these afferents are able to exert a powerful control over the electrical activity of the hippocampus. This strong influence is due to the fact that the majority of the extrinsic afferents terminate on a relatively small, but specific, populations of neurons that are able to control large areas of the hippocampal formation.},

	abstract = {The monocarboxylate transporter {MCT}4 is a proton-linked carrier particularly important for lactate release from highly glycolytic cells. In the central nervous system, {MCT}4 is exclusively expressed by astrocytes. Surprisingly, {MCT}4 expression in primary cultures of mouse cortical astrocytes is conspicuously low, suggesting that an external, nonastrocytic signal is necessary to obtain the observed pattern of expression in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that nitric oxide ({NO}), delivered by various {NO} donors, time- and dose-dependently induces {MCT}4 expression in cultured cortical astrocytes both at the {mRNA} and protein levels. In contrast, {NO} does not enhance the expression of {MCT}1, the other astrocytic monocarboxylate transporter. The transcriptional effect of {NO} is not mediated by a {cGMP}-dependent mechanism as shown by the absence of effect of a {cGMP} analog or of a selective guanylate cyclase inhibitor. {NO} causes an increase in astrocytic lactate transport capacity which requires the enhancement of {MCT}4 expression as both are prevented by the use of a specific {siRNA} against {MCT}4. In addition, cumulated lactate release by astrocytes over a period of 24 h was also enhanced by {NO} treatment. Our data suggest that {NO} represents a putative intercellular signal to control {MCT}4 expression in astrocytes and in doing so, to facilitate lactate transfer to other surrounding cell types in the central nervous system. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Oxidative stress and disrupted energy metabolism are common to many pathological conditions of the brain. Because astrocytes play an important role in the glucose metabolism of the brain, we have investigated whether sustained oxidative stress affects astroglial glucose metabolism with cultured primary rat astrocytes as a model system. Cultured astrocytes were exposed to a sustained concentration of approximately 50 μM H2O2 in the presence of [U-13C]glucose, and cellular and extracellular contents of lactate and glucose were analysed by enzymatic assays and {NMR} spectroscopy. Exposure of the cells to sustained H2O2 stress for up to 120 min significantly lowered the rate of lactate accumulation in the media to 61\% ± 14\% of that in cultures incubated without peroxide. In addition, the ratio of lactate release to glucose consumption was lowered in peroxide-treated astrocytes to 77\% ± 13\% of that in control cells, and the specific activity of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase had declined to about 10\% of control cells within 90 min. In addition, the 13C enrichment of intracellular and extracellular [13C]lactate was about 30\% and 95\%, respectively, and was not affected by the presence of peroxide, demonstrating that two metabolic pools of lactate are present in cultured astrocytes. The decreased rate of lactate production by astrocytes that have been exposed to peroxide stress is a new example of an alteration by oxidative stress of an important metabolic pathway in astrocytes. Such alterations could contribute to the pathological conditions that have been connected with oxidative stress and disrupted energy metabolism in the brain. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Astrogliosis and associated dysfunction of adenosine homeostasis are pathological hallmarks of the epileptic brain and thought to contribute to seizure generation in epilepsy. The authors hypothesized that astrogliosis—an early component of the epileptogenic cascade—might be linked to focal seizure onset. To isolate the contribution of astrogliosis to ictogenesis from other pathological events involved in epilepsy, the authors used a minimalistic model of epileptogenesis in mice, based on a focal onset status epilepticus triggered by intra-amygdaloid injection of kainic acid. The authors demonstrate acute neuronal cell loss restricted to the injected amygdala and ipsilateral {CA}3, followed 3 weeks later by focal astrogliosis and overexpression of the adenosine-metabolizing enzyme adenosine kinase ({ADK}). Using synchronous electroencephalographic recordings from multiple depth electrodes, the authors identify the {KA}-injected amygdala and ipsilateral {CA}3 as two independent foci for the initiation of non-synchronized electrographic subclinical seizures. Importantly, seizures remained focal and restricted to areas of {ADK} overexpression. However, after systemic application of a non-convulsive dose of an adenosine A1-receptor antagonist, seizures in amygdala and {CA}3 immediately synchronized and spread throughout the cortex, leading to convulsive seizures. This focal seizure phenotype remained stable over at least several weeks. We conclude that astrogliosis via disruption of adenosine homeostasis per se and in the absence of any other overt pathology, is associated with the emergence of spontaneous recurrent subclinical seizures, which remain stable over space and time. A secondary event, here mimicked by brain-wide disruption of adenosine signaling, is likely required to turn pre-existing subclinical seizures into a clinical seizure phenotype. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Pyruvate carboxylation ({PC}) is thought to be the major anaplerotic reaction for the tricarboxylic acid cycle and is necessary for de novo synthesis of amino acid neurotransmitters. In the brain, the main enzyme involved is pyruvate carboxylase, which is predominantly located in astrocytes. Carboxylation leads to the formation of oxaloacetate, which condenses with acetyl coenzyme A to form citrate. However, oxaloacetate may also be converted to malate and fumarate before being regenerated. This pathway is termed the oxaloacetate-fumarate-flux or backflux. Carbon isotope-based methods for quantification of activity of {PC} lead to underestimation when backflux is not taken into account and critical errors have been made in the interpretation of results from metabolic studies. This study was conducted to establish the degree of backflux after {PC} in cerebellar and neocortical astrocytes. Astrocyte cultures from cerebellum or neocortex were incubated with either [3-13C] or [2-13C]glucose, and extracts were analyzed using mass spectrometry or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Substantial {PC} compared with pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was observed, and extensive backflux was demonstrated in both types of astrocytes. The extent of backflux varied between the metabolites, reaffirming that metabolism is highly compartmentalized. By applying our calculations to published data, we demonstrate the existence of backflux in vivo in cat, rat, mouse, and human brain. Thus, backflux should be taken into account when calculating the magnitude of {PC} to allow for a more precise evaluation of cerebral metabolism. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Throughout the adult human brain, they express the {GABA} synthesizing enzyme {GAD} 67, the {GABA} metabolizing enzyme {GABA}-T, and the {GABAA} and {GABAB} receptors. {GABA} modulates the actions of microglia, indicating an important role for astrocytes beyond that of influencing neurotransmitter function. Here we report on the mechanisms by which astrocytes release {GABA}. Astrocytes were found to express the {mRNA} and protein for multiple {GABA} transporters, and multiple receptors for glutamate, {GABA}, and glycine. In culture, untreated human astrocytes maintained an intracellular {GABA} level of 2.32 {mM}. They exported {GABA} into the culture medium so that an intracellular-extracellular gradient of 3.64 fold was reached. Inhibitors of the {GABA} transporters {GAT}1, {GAT}2, and {GAT}3, significantly reduced this export in a Ca2+-independent fashion. Intracellular {GABA} levels were enhanced by treatment with the {GABA}-T inhibitors gabaculine or vigabatrin. Treatment with glutamate increased {GABA} release in a concentration-dependent fashion. This was partially inhibited by blockers of N-methyl-D-aspartate and kainate receptors. Conversely, glycine and D-serine, co-agonists of {NMDA} receptors, enhanced the {GABA} release. {GABA} release was accompanied by an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and was reduced by adding the Ca2+ chelator, {BAPTA}-{AM} to the medium. These data indicate that astrocytes continuously synthesize {GABA} and that there are multiple mechanisms which can mediate its release. Each of these may play a role in the physiological functioning of astrocytes. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Summary
This review highlights the progress made thus far in characterizing the behavioral and cellular mechanisms through which cannabinoids regulate energy homeostasis. We performed microstructural analysis of feeding behavior in gonadectomized guinea pigs and gonadally intact, transgenic {CB}1 receptor knockout mice to determine how cannabinoids affect circadian rhythms in food intake and meal pattern. We also implanted data loggers into the abdominal cavity to correlate the appetite-modulating properties of cannabinoids with changes in core body temperature. We then coupled the effects on feeding behavior and temperature regulation with synaptic changes in the hypothalamic feeding circuitry via whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiological recording from neurons in the arcuate nucleus ({ARC}), in order to gain a more global perspective on the cannabinoid modulation of energy homeostasis. We observed marked sex differences in cannabinoid effects on food intake and core body temperature – with male guinea pigs exhibiting a comparatively greater sensitivity to the hyperphagia and hypophagia, as well as the hypothermia and hyperthermia, produced by {CB}1 receptor agonists and antagonists, respectively. In addition, male but not female {CB}1 receptor knockout mice show a diminished nocturnal food intake and average daily body weight relative to their wildtype littermate controls. The disparity in the {CB}1 receptor-mediated hyperphagia is paralleled by sex differences in the cellular effects of cannabinoids at anorexigenic, guinea pig proopiomelanocortin ({POMC}) synapses. Postsynaptically, cannabinoids potentiate an A-type K+ current ({IA}) in {POMC} neurons from female guinea pigs, whereas in males the activation of an inwardly rectifying K+ current is observed. Presynaptically, while cannabinoids inhibit glutamatergic input onto {POMC} neurons in males and females to similar degrees, males are more refractory to the cannabinoid-induced inhibition of convergent {GABAergic} input than females. These data reveal pervasive sex differences in the cannabinoid regulation of energy homeostasis that are consistent with changes in the excitability of {POMC} neurons.},

	abstract = {The neuropathology of Parkinson's disease ({PD}) involves a reduction of endogenous antioxidant enzyme systems, heightened oxidative stress and mitochondrial aberrations in the region of the substantia nigra. Similarly, neurotoxins commonly used to investigate {PD} pathology include 6-hydroxydopamine (6-{OHDA}), a powerful hydrogen peroxide (H202) pro-oxidant and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion ({MPP}+), a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor that exerts detrimental effects on cellular energy production. Pyruvic acid is a neuronal metabolic energy fuel that can also rapidly undergo decarboxylation to diffuse H202 into H20. In this study, we investigated the effect of pyruvic acid against 6-{OHDA}, {MPP}+ and H202 toxicity in murine brain neuroblastoma cells. The results obtained indicated that the toxicity of 6-{OHDA} was inversely related to the autoxidative formation of H202. Pyruvic acid exhibited powerful non-enzymatic stoichiometric H202 trapping properties, and protected against both 6-{OHDA} and H202 toxicity. While both sodium pyruvate and pyruvate were highly protective against oxidative stress, pyruvate in its free acid form only was protective against {MPP}+, indicating a requirement for effective transport in order to fuel glycolysis. The protective properties of glucose were compared to pyruvic acid, and the data indicated that glucose did not exhibit antioxidant properties and was effective in blocking {MPP}+, but not 6-{OHDA} or H202 toxicity. On the other hand, pyruvic acid was protective against all three toxins, and unlike glucose, completely blocked {MPP}+ toxicity in a combination insult model with up to 500 μM of H202. Moreover, the data obtained indicate that pyruvic acid exerts powerful neuroprotective properties by providing simultaneous resistance to oxidative stress and mitochondrial insult. These protective effects are the result of a unique dual property of pyruvic acid with concurrent ability to serve as an effective neuronal energy substrate for glycolysis and to act as an exceptionally powerful antioxidant.},

Pyruvate, 9 mmoles/kg, was equivalent to glucose, 9 mmoles/kg, as a substrate for cerebral tricarboxylic acid ({TCA}) cycle activity. Inhibition of the glial {TCA} cycle with fluoroacetate did not affect formation of [4-13C]glutamate or [2-13C]{GABA} from [3-13C]pyruvate, but reduced formation of [4-13C]glutamine by 50\%, indicating predominantly neuronal metabolism of exogenous pyruvate. Extensive formation of [3-13C]lactate from [2-13C]pyruvate demonstrated reversible carboxylation of pyruvate to malate and equilibration with fumarate, presumably in neurones, but anaplerotic formation of {TCA} cycle intermediates from exogenous pyruvate could not be detected. Too rapid injection of large amounts of pyruvate led to seizure activity, respiratory arrest and death. We conclude that exogenous pyruvate is an excellent energy substrate for neurones in vivo, but that care must be taken to avoid the seizure-inducing effect of pyruvate given in large doses.},

	abstract = {A considerable body of evidence indicates that the activity of glutamine synthetase is decreased in the cerebral cortices of brains affected by Alzheimer’s disease. It is difficult to discern the reason for this decrease because it is not known whether the cellular distribution of glutamine synthetase is altered in Alzheimer’s disease. Therefore the present study has used immunocytochemistry to compare the cellular distributions of glutamine synthetase in the inferior temporal cortices of six Alzheimer’s diseased brains and six age-matched, non-demented brains. Double-label immunocytochemistry has been used to examine whether the distribution of cellular glutamine synthetase is influenced by the distribution of senile plaques. It was found that glutamine synthetase expression in astrocytes is diminished in Alzheimer’s disease, particularly in the vicinity of senile plaques. The most striking finding of the present study was that glutamine synthetase was expressed in a subpopulation of pyramidal neurons in all six Alzheimer’s diseased brains, whereas glutamine synthetase was not observed in any neurons from control brains. The changed expression of glutamine synthetase may be triggered by toxic agents in senile plaques, a reduced noradrenergic supply to the cerebral cortex, and increased brain ammonia levels. That such dramatic changes occur in the distribution of this critical, and normally stable enzyme, suggests that the glutamate–glutamine cycle is profoundly impaired in Alzheimer’s disease. This is significant because impairments of the glutamate–glutamine cycle are known to cause alterations of mood and behaviour, disturbance of sleeping patterns, amnesia, confusion and reduced awareness. Since these behavioural changes are also seen in Alzheimer’s disease, it is speculated that they might be attributable to the reduced expression of glutamine synthetase or to impairments of the glutamate–glutamine cycle.},

The aim of this work is to assess whether the antioxidant status and energy state of {RBC} from elderly people change in {AD}. We measured levels of key products and enzymes of oxidative metabolism in {RBC} from {AD} (n = 12) and non-Alzheimer dementia ({NA}, n = 13) patients, as well as in cells from age-matched controls ({AC}, n = 14) and younger adult controls ({YC}, n = 14). Parameters of the adenylate system served to evaluate the energy state of {RBC}. In both aging and dementia, oxidative stress in {RBC} increased and exhibited elevated concentrations of H2O2 and organic hydroperoxides, decreased the {GSH}/{GSSG} ratio and glutathione-S-transferase activity. Reductions in the {ATP} levels, adenine nucleotide pool size ({AN}) and adenylate energy charge accompanied these oxidative disturbances. The patterns of changes in these indices between groups strongly correlated with each other, Spearman rank correlation coefficients being rs = 1.0 or -1.0 (p{\textless}0.01). Alterations of the {RBC} parameters of oxidative stress and adenylate metabolism were nonspecific and interpreted as age-related abnormalities.

Recent studies revealed that {DHPG}-{LTD} is dependent on activation of postsynaptic protein tyrosine phosphatases ({PTPs}), which transiently dephosphorylate tyrosine residues in {AMPA} receptors ({AMPARs}). Here we show that while both endogenous {GluR}2 and {GluR}3 {AMPAR} subunits are tyrosine phosphorylated at basal activity, only {GluR}2 is dephosphorylated in {DHPG}-{LTD}. The tyrosine dephosphorylation of {GluR}2 does not occur in {NMDA}-{LTD}. Conversely, while {NMDA}-{LTD} is associated with the dephosphorylation of {GluR}1-serine-845, {DHPG}-{LTD} does not alter the phosphorylation of this site. The increased {AMPAR} endocytosis in {DHPG}-{LTD} is {PTP}-dependent and involves tyrosine dephosphorylation of cell surface {AMPARs}. Together, these results indicate that the subunit selective tyrosine dephosphorylation of surface {GluR}2 regulates {AMPAR} internalisation in {DHPG}-{LTD} but not in {NMDA}-{LTD} in the hippocampus.},

These processes are critical for some forms of synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation and long-term depression ({LTD}). In the case of {LTD}, {AMPARs} are internalized and dephosphorylated in response to {NMDA} receptor activation. However, the fate of the internalized receptors upon {LTD} induction and its relevance for synaptic function is still a matter of debate. Here we examined the functional contribution of receptor recycling versus degradation for {LTD} in rat hippocampal slices, and their correlation with receptor dephosphorylation. We observed that {GluA}1 undergoes sequential dephosphorylation and degradation in lysosomes after {LTD} induction. However, this degradation does not have functional consequences for the regulation of synaptic strength, and therefore, for the expression of {LTD}. In contrast, the partition of internalized {AMPARs} between Rab7-dependent trafficking (toward lysosomes) or Rab11-dependent endosomes (recycling back toward synapses) is the key factor determining the extent of synaptic depression upon {LTD} induction. This sorting decision is related to the phosphorylation status of {GluA}1 Ser845, the dephosphorylated receptors being those preferentially targeted for lysosomal degradation. Altogether, these new data contribute to clarify the fate of {AMPARs} during {LTD} and emphasize the importance of membrane sorting decisions to determine the outcome of synaptic plasticity.},

We use a novel technique to extract pathway-specific local field potentials ({LFPs}) in the hippocampus to explore the ongoing temporal structure of a single presynaptic input, the {CA}3 Schaffer pathway, and its contribution to the spontaneous output of {CA}1 units in anesthetized rat. We found that Schaffer-specific {LFPs} are composed of a regular succession of pulse-like excitatory packages initiated by spontaneous clustered firing of {CA}3 pyramidal cells to which individual units contribute variably. A fraction of these packages readily induce firing of {CA}1 pyramidal cells and interneurons, the so-called Schaffer-driven spikes, revealing the presynaptic origin in the output code of single {CA}1 units. The output of 70\% of {CA}1 pyramidal neurons contains up to 10\% of such spikes. Our results suggest a hierarchical internal operation of the {CA}3 region based on sequential oscillatory activation of pyramidal cell assemblies whose activity partly gets in the output code at the next station. We conclude that {CA}1 output may directly reflect the activity of specific ensembles of {CA}3 neurons. Thus, the fine temporal structure of pathway-specific {LFPs}, as an accurate readout of the activity of a presynaptic population, is useful in searching for hidden presynaptic code in irregular spikes series of individual neurons and assemblies.},

Baclofen, a gamma-aminobutyric acid B ({GABAB}) receptor agonist, infused into the {ICX} increased phasic motor activity in slow wave sleep ({SWS}) and {REM} sleep and tonic muscle activity in {REM} sleep; it also elicited {RBD}-like activity during the infusion and post-infusion period. In contrast, saclofen, a {GABAB} receptor antagonist, did not produce significant changes in motor activities in sleep. Baclofen infusions in {ICX} also significantly increased {REM} sleep during the post-infusion period, while saclofen infusions did not change the amount of any sleep–waking states. 
Conclusions 
This study suggests that {GABAB} receptor mechanisms in the {ICX} may be implicated in the pathology of {RBD}.},

Previous studies from our group have shown that this nucleus is a critical relay between reticularis pontis oralis and the medial septum/diagonal band, regarded as the main activator and the pacemaker of the hippocampal oscillations, respectively. Besides, the nucleus incertus is highly linked to activated states related to the arousal response. The neurotransmission of the nucleus incertus, however, remains uncertain. Only {GABA} and the neuromodulator relaxin 3 are usually considered to be involved in its contribution to the septohippocampal system. In this work, we have analyzed the existence of an excitatory projection from the nucleus incertus to the medial septum. We have found a group of glutamatergic neurons in the nucleus incertus projecting to the medial septum. Moreover, we were able to describe a segregated distribution of calbindin and calretinin neurons. While calretinin expression was restricted to the nucleus incertus pars compacta, calbindin positive neurons where observed both in the pars dissipata and the pars compacta of the nucleus. The present work provides innovative data supporting an excitatory component in the pontoseptal pathway.},

	abstract = {{AMPA} receptors mediate fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain, and are dynamically regulated by phosphorylation of multiple residues within the C-terminal domain. {CaMKII} phosphorylates Ser831 within the {AMPA} receptor {GluA}1 subunit to increase single channel conductance, and biochemical studies show that {PKC} can also phosphorylate this residue. In light of the discovery of additional {PKC} phosphorylation sites within the {GluA}1 C-terminus, it remains unclear whether {PKC} phosphorylation of Ser831 increases {GluA}1 conductance in intact receptors. Here, we report that the purified, catalytic subunit of {PKC} significantly increases the conductance of wild-type {GluA}1 {AMPA} receptors expressed in the presence of stargazin in {HEK}293T cells. Furthermore, the mutation {GluA}1-S831A blocks the functional effect of {PKC}. These findings suggest that {GluA}1 {AMPA} receptor conductance can be increased by activated {CaMKII} or {PKC}, and that phosphorylation at this site provides a mechanism for channel modulation via a variety of protein signaling cascades.},

	abstract = {Corticostriatal synapse plasticity of medium spiny neurons is regulated by glutamate input from the cortex and dopamine input from the substantia nigra. While cortical stimulation alone results in long-term depression ({LTD}), the combination with dopamine switches {LTD} to long-term potentiation ({LTP}), which is known as dopamine-dependent plasticity. {LTP} is also induced by cortical stimulation in magnesium-free solution, which leads to massive calcium influx through {NMDA}-type receptors and is regarded as calcium-dependent plasticity. Signaling cascades in the corticostriatal spines are currently under investigation. However, because of the existence of multiple excitatory and inhibitory pathways with loops, the mechanisms regulating the two types of plasticity remain poorly understood. A signaling pathway model of spines that express D1-type dopamine receptors was constructed to analyze the dynamic mechanisms of dopamine- and calcium-dependent plasticity. The model incorporated all major signaling molecules, including dopamine- and cyclic {AMP}-regulated phosphoprotein with a molecular weight of 32 {kDa} ({DARPP}32), as well as {AMPA} receptor trafficking in the post-synaptic membrane. Simulations with dopamine and calcium inputs reproduced dopamine- and calcium-dependent plasticity. Further in silico experiments revealed that the positive feedback loop consisted of protein kinase A ({PKA}), protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A), and the phosphorylation site at threonine 75 of {DARPP}-32 (Thr75) served as the major switch for inducing {LTD} and {LTP}. Calcium input modulated this loop through the {PP}2B (phosphatase 2B)-{CK}1 (casein kinase 1)-Cdk5 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5)-Thr75 pathway and {PP}2A, whereas calcium and dopamine input activated the loop via {PKA} activation by cyclic {AMP} ({cAMP}). The positive feedback loop displayed robust bi-stable responses following changes in the reaction parameters. Increased basal dopamine levels disrupted this dopamine-dependent plasticity. The present model elucidated the mechanisms involved in bidirectional regulation of corticostriatal synapses and will allow for further exploration into causes and therapies for dysfunctions such as drug addiction., Recent brain imaging and neurophysiological studies suggest that the striatum, the start of the basal ganglia circuit, plays a major role in value-based decision making and behavioral disorders such as drug addiction. The plasticity of synaptic input from the cerebral cortex to output neurons of the striatum, which are medium spiny neurons, depends on interactions between glutamate input from the cortex and dopaminergic input from the midbrain. It also links sensory and cognitive states in the cortex with reward-oriented action outputs. The mechanisms involved in molecular cascades that transmit glutamate and dopamine inputs to changes in postsynaptic glutamate receptors are very complex and it is difficult to intuitively understand the mechanism. Therefore, a biochemical network model was constructed, and computer simulations were performed. The model reproduced dopamine-dependent and calcium-dependent forms of long-term depression ({LTD}) and potentiation ({LTP}) of corticostriatal synapses. Further in silico experiments revealed that a positive feedback loop formed by proteins, the protein specifically expressed in the striatum, served as the major switch for inducing {LTD} and {LTP}. This model could allow us to understand dynamic constraints in reward-dependent learning, as well as causes and therapies of dopamine-related disorders such as drug addiction.},

Interneurons are known to make inhibitory synaptic connections with hippocampal {CA}1 pyramidal neurons through feedforward and feedback inhibitory networks. However, the roles of different inhibitory network structures on {STDP} remain unknown. Using a simplified hippocampal network model with a deterministic Ca2+ dynamics-dependent {STDP} model, we show that feedforward and feedback inhibitory networks differentially modulate {STDP}. Moreover, inhibitory synaptic weight and synaptic location influenced the {STDP} profile.

	abstract = {Huntington's disease ({HD}) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder that targets the corticostriatal system and results in progressive deterioration of cognitive, emotional, and motor skills. Although cortical and striatal neurons are widely studied in animal models of {HD}, there is little information on neuronal function during expression of the {HD} behavioral phenotype. To address this knowledge gap, we used chronically implanted micro-wire bundles to record extracellular spikes and local field potentials ({LFPs}) in truncated (R6/1 and R6/2) and full-length (knock-in, {KI}) mouse models as well as in transgenic {HD} rats ({tgHD} rats) behaving in an open-field arena. Spike activity was recorded in the striatum of all models and in prefrontal cortex ({PFC}) of R6/2 and {KI} mice, and in primary motor cortex (M1) of R6/2 mice. We also recorded {LFP} activity in R6/2 striatum. All {HD} models exhibited altered neuronal activity relative to wild-type ({WT}) controls. Although there was no consistent effect on firing rate across models and brain areas, burst firing was reduced in striatum, {PFC}, and M1 of R6/2 mice, and in striatum of {KI} mice. Consistent with a decline in bursting, the inter-spike-interval coefficient of variation was reduced in all regions of all models, except {PFC} of {KI} mice and striatum of {tgHD} rats. Among simultaneously recorded neuron pairs, correlated firing was reduced in all brain regions of all models, while coincident bursting, which measures the temporal overlap between bursting pairs, was reduced in striatum of all models as well as in M1 of R6/2s. Preliminary analysis of striatal {LFPs} revealed aberrant behavior-related oscillations in the delta to theta range and in gamma activity. Collectively, our results indicate that disrupted corticostriatal processing occurs across multiple {HD} models despite differences in the severity of the behavioral phenotype. Efforts aimed at normalizing corticostriatal activity may hold the key to developing new {HD} therapeutics.},

	abstract = {Trigeminal ganglia neurons express the {GABA}(A) receptor subunit alpha 6 (Gabrα6) but the role of this particular subunit in orofacial hypersensitivity is unknown. In this report the function of Gabrα6 was tested by reducing its expression in the trigeminal ganglia and measuring the effect of this reduction on inflammatory temporomandibular joint ({TMJ}) hypersensitivity. Gabrα6 expression was reduced by infusing the trigeminal ganglia of male Sprague Dawley rats with small interfering {RNA} ({siRNA}) having homology to either the Gabrα6 gene (Gabrα6 {siRNA}) or no known gene (control {siRNA}). Sixty hours after {siRNA} infusion the rats received a bilateral {TMJ} injection of complete Freund's adjuvant to induce an inflammatory response. Hypersensitivity was then quantitated by measuring meal duration, which lengthens when hypersensitivity increases. Neuronal activity in the trigeminal ganglia was also measured by quantitating the amount of phosphorylated {ERK}. Rats in a different group that did not have {TMJ} inflammation had an electrode placed in the spinal cord at the level of C1 sixty hours after {siRNA} infusion to record extracellular electrical activity of neurons that responded to {TMJ} stimulation. Our results show that Gabrα6 was expressed in both neurons and satellite glia of the trigeminal ganglia and that Gabrα6 positive neurons within the trigeminal ganglia have afferents in the {TMJ}. Gabrα6 {siRNA} infusion reduced Gabrα6 gene expression by 30\% and significantly lengthened meal duration in rats with {TMJ} inflammation. Gabrα6 {siRNA} infusion also significantly increased p-{ERK} expression in the trigeminal ganglia of rats with {TMJ} inflammation and increased electrical activity in the spinal cord of rats without {TMJ} inflammation. These results suggest that maintaining Gabrα6 expression was necessary to inhibit primary sensory afferents in the trigeminal pathway and reduce inflammatory orofacial nociception.},

	abstract = {In order to understand how retinal circuits encode visual scenes, the neural activity of defined populations of retinal ganglion cells ({RGCs}) has to be investigated. Here we report on a method for stimulating, detecting, and subsequently targeting defined populations of {RGCs}. The possibility to select a distinct population of {RGCs} for extracellular recording enables the design of experiments that can increase our understanding of how these neurons extract precise spatio-temporal features from the visual scene, and how the brain interprets retinal signals. We used light stimulation to elicit a response from physiologically distinct types of {RGCs} and then utilized the dynamic-configurability capabilities of a microelectronics-based high-density microelectrode array ({MEA}) to record their synchronous action potentials. The layout characteristics of the {MEA} made it possible to stimulate and record from multiple, highly overlapping {RGCs} simultaneously without light-induced artifacts. The high-density of electrodes and the high signal-to-noise ratio of the {MEA} circuitry allowed for recording of the activity of each {RGC} on 14±7 electrodes. The spatial features of the electrical activity of each {RGC} greatly facilitated spike sorting. We were thus able to localize, identify and record from defined {RGCs} within a region of mouse retina. In addition, we stimulated and recorded from genetically modified {RGCs} to demonstrate the applicability of optogenetic methods, which introduces an additional feature to target a defined cell type. The developed methodologies can likewise be applied to other neuronal preparations including brain slices or cultured neurons.},

	abstract = {The neural network stores information through activity-dependent synaptic plasticity that occurs in populations of neurons. Persistent forms of synaptic plasticity may account for long-term memory storage, and the most salient forms are the changes in the structure of synapses. The theory proposes that encoding should use a sparse code and evidence suggests that this can be achieved through offline reactivation or by sparse initial recruitment of the network units. This idea implies that in some cases the neurons that underwent structural synaptic plasticity might be a subpopulation of those originally recruited; However, it is not yet clear whether all the neurons recruited during acquisition are the ones that underwent persistent forms of synaptic plasticity and responsible for memory retrieval. To determine which neural units underlie long-term memory storage, we need to characterize which are the persistent forms of synaptic plasticity occurring in these neural ensembles and the best hints so far are the molecular signals underlying structural modifications of the synapses. Structural synaptic plasticity can be achieved by the activity of various signal transduction pathways, including the {NMDA}-{CaMKII} and {ACh}-{MAPK}. These pathways converge with the Rho family of {GTPases} and the consequent {ERK} 1/2 activation, which regulates multiple cellular functions such as protein translation, protein trafficking, and gene transcription. The most detailed explanation may come from models that allow us to determine the contribution of each piece of this fascinating puzzle that is the neuron and the neural network.},

Most spike-sorting algorithms are based on initial spike detection (e.g. by a voltage threshold) and subsequent waveform classification. Much effort has been devoted to the clustering step, despite the fact that conservative spike detection is notoriously difficult in low signal-to-noise conditions and often entails many spike misses. Hidden Markov models ({HMMs}) can serve as generative models for continuous extracellular data records. These models naturally combine the spike detection and classification steps into a single computational procedure. They unify the advantages of independent component analysis ({ICA}) and overlap-search algorithms because they blindly perform source separation even in cases where several neurons are recorded on a single electrode. We apply {HMMs} to artificially generated data and to extracellular signals recorded with glass electrodes. We show that in comparison with state-of-art spike-sorting algorithms, {HMM}-based spike sorting exhibits a comparable number of false positive spike classifications but many fewer spike misses.},

As such, they have been implicated in a wide range of neurodegenerative disorders. Histone acetylation involves the presentation of an acetyl group to lysine residues at the N terminus of histone proteins. Conversely, histone deacetylation involves the detachment of acetyl groups. Transcriptionally active chromatin is linked to acetylated histones, and in mouse neurons, is implicated in proper learning and memory. Proper functioning of histone deacetylases ({HDACs}) plays a pivotal role in histone acetylation homeostasis. A wide range of brain disorders are associated with improper balances within histone acetylation mechanisms, resulting in transcriptional dysfunction and translational disparities. Treatment modalities with various {HDAC} inhibitors have emerged as potential new strategies for therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative disease. {HDAC} inhibitors enhance synaptic plasticity, learning and memory in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease ({AD}), Huntington's disease ({HD}) and Parkinson's disease ({PD}). In this review, we discuss a variety of in vitro cellular models and in vivo mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases and the potential application of {HDAC} inhibitors to prevent and treat these disorders.},

Interneurons differ extensively in their intrinsic firing rates, their recruitment in different brain rhythms, and in their synaptic kinetics. Furthermore, in common with principal neurons, both the synapses innervating interneurons and the synapses made by these cells are highly modifiable, reflecting both their recent or remote use (short-term and long-term plasticity) and the action of extracellular messengers.

	doi = {10.1038/nature11305},
	abstract = {Dendritic arborizations of many neurons are patterned by a process called self-avoidance, in which branches arising from a single neuron repel each other. By minimizing gaps and overlaps within the arborization, self-avoidance facilitates complete coverage of a neuron's territory by its neurites. Remarkably, some neurons that display self-avoidance interact freely with other neurons of the same subtype, implying that they discriminate self from non-self. Here we demonstrate roles for the clustered protocadherins (Pcdhs) in dendritic self-avoidance and self/non-self discrimination. The Pcdh locus encodes 58 related cadherin-like transmembrane proteins, at least some of which exhibit isoform-specific homophilic adhesion in heterologous cells and are expressed stochastically and combinatorially in single neurons. Deletion of all 22 Pcdh genes in the mouse γ-subcluster (Pcdhg genes) disrupts self-avoidance of dendrites in retinal starburst amacrine cells ({SACs}) and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Further genetic analysis of {SACs} showed that Pcdhg proteins act cell-autonomously during development, and that replacement of the 22 Pcdhg proteins with a single isoform restores self-avoidance. Moreover, expression of the same single isoform in all {SACs} decreases interactions among dendrites of neighbouring {SACs} (heteroneuronal interactions). These results suggest that homophilic Pcdhg interactions between sibling neurites (isoneuronal interactions) generate a repulsive signal that leads to self-avoidance. In this model, heteroneuronal interactions are normally permitted because dendrites seldom encounter a matched set of Pcdhg proteins unless they emanate from the same soma. In many respects, our results mirror those reported for Dscam1 (Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule) in Drosophila: this complex gene encodes thousands of recognition molecules that exhibit stochastic expression and isoform-specific interactions, and mediate both self-avoidance and self/non-self discrimination. Thus, although insect Dscam and vertebrate Pcdh proteins share no sequence homology, they seem to underlie similar strategies for endowing neurons with distinct molecular identities and patterning their arborizations.},

	abstract = {Synapses are highly specialized structures designed to guarantee precise and efficient communication between neurons and their target cells. Molecules of the extracellular matrix have an instructive role in the formation of the neuromuscular junction, the best-characterized synapse. In this review, the molecular mechanisms underlying these instructive signals will be discussed with particular emphasis on the receptors involved. Additionally, recent evidence for the involvement of specific adhesion complexes in the formation and modulation of synapses in the central nervous system will be reviewed. Synapses are specialized junctions between neurons and their target cells where information is transferred from the pre- to the postsynaptic cell. At most vertebrate synapses, this transfer is accomplished by the release of a specific neurotransmitter from the presynaptic nerve terminal. The release of neurotransmitter is initiated by the action potential and the subsequent influx of Ca2+ into the presynaptic nerve terminal. This results in the rapid fusion of vesicles with the nerve membrane and the release of the neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitter then diffuses across the cleft and binds to specific postsynaptic receptors, resulting in a change in the membrane potential of the postsynaptic cell. This can result in the generation of an action potential. The high precision of synaptic transmission requires that pre- and postsynaptic structures are both highly organized and in juxtaposition to each other. In addition, alterations in synaptic transmission are the basis of learning and memory and are likely to be accompanied by the remodeling of synaptic structures (Toni et al., 1999). Thus, the study of how synapses are formed during development is also of relevance for the understanding of the cellular and molecular processes involved in learning and memory. This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms involved in the formation and the function of synapses.},

Transcription of clock genes is sensitive to metabolic changes in reduction and oxidation (redox); however, circadian cycles in protein oxidation have been reported in anucleate cells, where no transcription occurs. We tested whether the {SCN} also expresses redox cycles and how such metabolic oscillations might affect neuronal physiology. We detected self-sustained circadian rhythms of {SCN} redox state that required the molecular clockwork. The redox oscillation could determine the excitability of {SCN} neurons through nontranscriptional modulation of multiple K(+) channels. Thus, dynamic regulation of {SCN} excitability appears to be closely tied to metabolism that engages the clockwork machinery.},

Although the major contributor of the extracellular signal is the synaptic transmembrane current, other sources — including Na+ and Ca2+ spikes, ionic fluxes through voltage- and ligand-gated channels, and intrinsic membrane oscillations — can substantially shape the extracellular field. High-density recordings of field activity in animals and subdural grid recordings in humans, combined with recently developed data processing tools and computational modelling, can provide insight into the cooperative behaviour of neurons, their average synaptic input and their spiking output, and can increase our understanding of how these processes contribute to the extracellular signal.},

Epigenetic mechanisms such as {DNA} methylation and modifications to histone proteins regulate high-order {DNA} structure and gene expression. Aberrant epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the development of many diseases, including cancer. The neurological disorder most intensely studied with regard to epigenetic changes is Rett syndrome; patients with Rett syndrome have neurodevelopmental defects associated with mutations in {MeCP}2, which encodes the methyl {CpG} binding protein 2, that binds to methylated {DNA}. Other mental retardation disorders are also linked to the disruption of genes involved in epigenetic mechanisms; such disorders include alpha thalassaemia/mental retardation X-linked syndrome, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, and Coffin-Lowry syndrome. Moreover, aberrant {DNA} methylation and histone modification profiles of discrete {DNA} sequences, and those at a genome-wide level, have just begun to be described for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, and in other neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In this Review, we describe epigenetic changes present in neurological diseases and discuss the therapeutic potential of epigenetic drugs, such as histone deacetylase inhibitors.},

	abstract = {The entorhinal cortex ({EC}) plays an important role in temporal lobe epilepsy. Under normal conditions, the enriched cholinergic innervation of the {EC} modulates local synchronized oscillatory activity; however, its role in epilepsy is unknown. Enhanced neuronal activation has been shown to induce transcriptional changes of key cholinergic genes and thus alter cholinergic responses. To examine cholinergic modulations in epileptic tissue we studied molecular and electrophysiological cholinergic responses in the {EC} of chronically epileptic rats following exposure to pilocarpine or kainic acid. We confirmed that while the total activity of the acetylcholine ({ACh})-hydrolysing enzyme, acetylcholinesterase ({AChE}) was not altered, epileptic rats showed alternative splicing of {AChE} pre-{mRNA} transcripts, accompanied by a shift from membrane-bound {AChE} tetramers to soluble monomers. This was associated with increased sensitivity to {ACh} application: thus, in control rats, {ACh} (10–100 µm) induced slow ({\textless} 1Hz), periodic events confined to the {EC}; however, in epileptic rats, {ACh} evoked seconds-long seizure-like events with initial appearance in the {EC}, and frequent propagation to neighbouring cortical regions. {ACh}-induced seizure-like events could be completely blocked by the non-specific muscarinic antagonist, atropine, and were partially blocked by the muscarinic-1 receptor antagonist, pirenzepine; but were not affected by the non-specific nicotinic antagonist, mecamylamine. Epileptic rats presented reduced transcript levels of muscarinic receptors with no evidence of {mRNA} editing or altered {mRNA} levels for nicotinic {ACh} receptors. Our findings suggest that altered cholinergic modulation may initiate seizure events in the epileptic temporal cortex.},

	abstract = {Formation of H2O2 has been studied in rat heart mitochondria, pretreated with H2O2 and aminotriazole to lower their antioxidant capacity. It is shown that the rate of H2O2 formation by mitochondria oxidizing 6 {mM} succinate is inhibited by a protonophorous uncoupler, {ADP} and phosphate, malonate, rotenone and myxothiazol, and is stimulated by antimycin A. The effect of {ADP} is abolished by carboxyatractylate and oligomycin. Addition of uncoupler after rotenone induces further inhibition of H2O2 production. Inhibition of H2O2 formation by uncoupler, malonate and {ADP}+Pi is shown to be proportional to the ΔΨ decrease by these compounds. A threshold ΔΨ value is found, above which a very strong increase in H2O2 production takes place. This threshold slightly exceeds the state 3 ΔΨ level. The data obtained are in line with the concept [Skulachev, V.P., Q. Rev. Biophys. 29 (1996), 169–202] that a high proton motive force in state 4 is potentially dangerous for the cell due to an increase in the probability of superoxide formation.},

	abstract = {The ventromedial hypothalamus is involved in regulating feeding and satiety behavior, and its neurons interact with specialized ependymal-glial cells, termed tanycytes. The latter express glucose-sensing proteins, including glucose transporter 2, glucokinase, and {ATP}-sensitive K+ ({KATP}) channels, suggesting their involvement in hypothalamic glucosensing. Here, the transduction mechanism involved in the glucose-induced rise of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in cultured β-tanycytes was examined. Fura-2AM time-lapse fluorescence images revealed that glucose increases the intracellular Ca2+ signal in a concentration-dependent manner. Glucose transportation, primarily via glucose transporters, and metabolism via anaerobic glycolysis increased connexin 43 (Cx43) hemichannel activity, evaluated by ethidium uptake and whole cell patch clamp recordings, through a {KATP} channel-dependent pathway. Consequently, {ATP} export to the extracellular milieu was enhanced, resulting in activation of purinergic P2Y1 receptors followed by inositol trisphosphate receptor activation and Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. The present study identifies the mechanism by which glucose increases [Ca2+]i in tanycytes. It also establishes that Cx43 hemichannels can be rapidly activated under physiological conditions by the sequential activation of glucosensing proteins in normal tanycytes. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {During normal brain development, axons are myelinated by mature oligodendrocytes ({OLGs}). Under pathological, demyelinating conditions within the central nervous system ({CNS}), axonal remyelination is only partially successful because oligodendrocyte precursor cells ({OPCs}) largely remain in an undifferentiated state resulting in a failure to generate myelinating {OLGs}. Tissue Transglutaminase ({TG}2) is a multifunctional enzyme, which amongst other functions, is involved in cell differentiation. Therefore, we hypothesized that {TG}2 contributes to differentiation of {OPCs} into {OLGs} and thereby stimulates remyelination. In vivo studies, using the cuprizone model for de- and remyelination in {TG}2−/− and wild-type mice, showed that during remyelination expression of proteolipid protein {mRNA}, as a marker for remyelination, in the corpus callosum lags behind in {TG}2−/− mice resulting in less myelin formation and, moreover, impaired recovery of motor behavior. Subsequent in vitro studies showed that rat {OPCs} express {TG}2 protein and activity which reduces when the cells have matured into {OLGs}. Furthermore, when {TG}2 activity is pharmacologically inhibited, the differentiation of {OPCs} into myelin-forming {OLGs} is dramatically reduced. We conclude that {TG}2 plays a prominent role in remyelination of the {CNS}, probably through stimulating {OPC} differentiation into myelin-forming {OLGs}. Therefore, manipulating {TG}2 activity may represent an interesting new target for remyelination in demyelinating diseases. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Their endogenous ligands, the endocannabinoids, have also been identified. {CB}1 receptors and endocannabinoids are present in brain structures controlling energy intake and in peripheral cells (hepatocytes, adipocytes, pancreatic islet cells) regulating energy homeostasis. {CB}2 receptors are more abundant in lymphocytes and macrophages, and participate in immune and inflammatory reactions. Metabolic hormones and peptides regulate the levels of the endocannabinoids and, hence, the activity of cannabinoid receptors in several tissues in a seemingly coordinated way. The endocannabinoids, particularly after stress and brief food deprivation, act in turn as local modulators of the expression and action of neurotransmitters, hormones and adipokines involved in metabolic control. Endocannabinoid overactivity seems to accompany metabolic and eating disorders and to contribute to the development of abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia. Accordingly, clinical trials have shown that {CB}1 receptor antagonists are efficacious at reducing not only food intake, but also abdominal adiposity and its metabolic sequelae.},

	abstract = {Many different regulatory actions have been attributed to endocannabinoids, and their involvement in several pathophysiological conditions is under intense scrutiny. Cannabinoid receptors [cannabinoid receptor type 1 ({CB}1) and {CB}2] participate in the physiological modulation of many central and peripheral functions. The ability of the endocannabinoid system to control appetite, food intake and energy balance has recently received considerable attention, particularly in the light of the different modes of action underlying these functions. The endocannabinoid system modulates rewarding properties of food by acting at specific mesolimbic areas in the brain. In the hypothalamus, {CB}1 receptors and endocannabinoids are integrated components of the networks controlling appetite and food intake. Interestingly, the endocannabinoid system was recently shown to control several metabolic functions by acting on peripheral tissues such as adipocytes, hepatocytes, the gastrointestinal tract, the skeletal muscles and the endocrine pancreas. The relevance of the system is further strengthened by the notion that visceral obesity seems to be a condition in which an overactivation of the endocannabinoid system occurs, and therefore drugs interfering with this overactivation by blocking {CB}1 receptors are considered as potentially valuable candidates for the treatment of obesity and related cardiometabolic risk factors.},

	abstract = {The role played by the endocannabinoid system in the regulation of energy balance is currently generating a great amount of interest among several groups of investigators. This interest in large part comes from the urgent need to develop anti-obesity and anti-cachexia drugs around target systems (such as the endocannabinoid system), which appears to be genuinely involved in energy balance regulation. When activated, the endocannabinoid system favors energy deposition through increasing energy intake and reducing energy expenditure. This system is activated in obesity and following food deprivation, which further supports its authentic function in energy balance regulation. The cannabinoid receptor type 1 ({CB}1), one of the two identified cannabinoid receptors, is expressed in energy-balance brain structures that are also able to readily produce or inactivate N-arachidonoyl ethanolamine (anandamide) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2AG), the most abundantly formed and released endocannabinoids. The brain action of endocannabinoid system on energy balance seems crucial and needs to be delineated in the context of the homeostatic and hedonic controls of food intake and energy expenditure. These controls require the coordinated interaction of the hypothalamus, brainstem and limbic system and it appears imperative to unravel those interplays. It is also critical to investigate the metabolic endocannabinoid system while considering the panoply of functions that the endocannabinoid system fulfills in the brain and other tissues. This article aims at reviewing the potential mechanisms whereby the brain endocannabinoid system influences the regulation energy balance.},

	abstract = {Anandamide and the other N-acylethanolamines, e.g. oleoylethanolamide ({OEA}), palmitoylethanolamide ({PEA}), and linoleoylethanolamide ({LEA}), may be formed by several enzymatic pathways from their precursors, which are the N-acylated ethanolamine phospholipids. The exact enzymatic pathways involved in their biosynthesis in specific tissues are not clarified. It has been suggested that endogenous anandamide could stimulate food intake by activation of cannabinoid receptors in the brain and/or in the intestinal tissue. On the other hand, endogenous {OEA} and {PEA} have been suggested to inhibit food intake by acting on receptors in the intestine. At present, there is no clear role for endogenous anandamide in controlling food intake via cannabinoid receptors, neither centrally nor in the gastrointestinal tract.

However, {OEA}, {PEA} and perhaps also {LEA} may be involved in regulation of food intake by selective prolongation of feeding latency and post-meal interval. These N-acylethanolamines seem to be formed locally in the intestine, where they can activate {PPARα} located in close proximity to their site of synthesis. The rapid onset of {OEA} response and its reliance on an intact vagus nerve suggests that activation of {PPARα} does not result in formation of a transcription-dependent signal but must rely on an unidentified non-genomic signal that translates to activation of vagal afferents. Whether {GPR}119, {TRPV}1 and/or intestinal ceramide levels also contribute to the anorectic and weight-reducing effect of exogenous {OEA} is less clear.

Prolonged intake of dietary fat (45\&\#xa0;energy\%) may promote over-consumption of food by decreasing the endogenous levels of {OEA}, {PEA} and {LEA} in the intestine.},

The {ECS} regulates many aspects of embryological development and homeostasis, including neuroprotection and neural plasticity, immunity and inflammation, apoptosis and carcinogenesis, pain and emotional memory, and the focus of this review: hunger, feeding, and metabolism. This mini-review summarizes the main findings that supported the clinical use of {CB}1 antagonists/inverse agonists, the clinical concerns that have emerged, and the possible future of cannabinoid-based therapy of obesity and related diseases. The {ECS} controls energy balance and lipid metabolism centrally (in the hypothalamus and mesolimbic pathways) and peripherally (in adipocytes, liver, skeletal muscle and pancreatic islet cells), acting through numerous anorexigenic and orexigenic pathways. Obese people seem to display an increased endocannabinoid tone, driving {CB}1 receptor in a feed-forward dysfunction. Several {CB}1 antagonists/inverse agonists have been developed for the treatment of obesity. Although these drugs were found to be efficacious at reducing food intake as well as abdominal adiposity and cardiometabolic risk factors, they resulted in adverse psychiatric effects that limited their use and finally led to the end of the clinical use of systemic {CB}1 ligands with significant inverse agonist activity for complicated obesity. However, the existence of alternatives such as {CB}1 partial agonists, neutral antagonists, antagonists restricted to the periphery, allosteric modulators and other potential targets within the {ECS} indicate that a cannabinoid-based therapy for the management of obesity and its associated cardiometabolic sequelae should remain open for consideration.},

	abstract = {Transcription is a molecular requisite for long-term synaptic plasticity and long-term memory formation. Thus, in the last several years, one main interest of molecular neuroscience has been the identification of families of transcription factors that are involved in both of these processes. Transcription is a highly regulated process that involves the combined interaction and function of chromatin and many other proteins, some of which are essential for the basal process of transcription, while others control the selective activation or repression of specific genes. These regulated interactions ultimately allow a sophisticated response to multiple environmental conditions, as well as control of spatial and temporal differences in gene expression. Evidence based on correlative changes in expression, genetic mutations, and targeted molecular inhibition of gene expression have shed light on the function of transcription in both synaptic plasticity and memory formation. This review provides a brief overview of experimental work showing that several families of transcription factors, including {CREB}, C/{EBP}, Egr, {AP}-1, and Rel, have essential functions in both processes. The results of this work suggest that patterns of transcription regulation represent the molecular signatures of long-term synaptic changes and memory formation.},

	doi = {10.3791/2704},
	abstract = {Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) is critical for maintaining the physiological function of the respiratory chain to generate {ATP}. A significant loss of ΔΨm renders cells depleted of energy with subsequent death. Reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) are important signaling molecules, but their accumulation in pathological conditions leads to oxidative stress. The two major sources of {ROS} in cells are environmental toxins and the process of oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress have been implicated in the pathophysiology of many diseases; therefore, the ability to determine ΔΨm and {ROS} can provide important clues about the physiological status of the cell and the function of the mitochondria.

Several fluorescent probes (Rhodamine 123, {TMRM}, {TMRE}, {JC}-1) can be used to determine Δψm in a variety of cell types, and many fluorescence indicators (Dihydroethidium, Dihydrorhodamine 123, H2DCF-{DA}) can be used to determine {ROS}. Nearly all of the available fluorescence probes used to assess ΔΨm or {ROS} are single-wavelength indicators, which increase or decrease their fluorescence intensity proportional to a stimulus that increases or decreases the levels of ΔΨm or {ROS}. Thus, it is imperative to measure the fluorescence intensity of these probes at the baseline level and after the application of a specific stimulus. This allows one to determine the percentage of change in fluorescence intensity between the baseline level and a stimulus. This change in fluorescence intensity reflects the change in relative levels of ΔΨm or {ROS}. In this video, we demonstrate how to apply the fluorescence indicator, {TMRM}, in rat cortical neurons to determine the percentage change in {TMRM} fluorescence intensity between the baseline level and after applying {FCCP}, a mitochondrial uncoupler. The lower levels of {TMRM} fluorescence resulting from {FCCP} treatment reflect the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential. We also show how to apply the fluorescence probe H2DCF-{DA} to assess the level of {ROS} in cortical neurons, first at baseline and then after application of H2O2. This protocol (with minor modifications) can be also used to determine changes in ∆Ψm and {ROS} in different cell types and in neurons isolated from other brain regions.},

	abstract = {We investigated the use of rhodamine 123 (R123), tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester ({TMRM}), and tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester ({TMRE}) as fluorescent probes to monitor the membrane potential of mitochondria. These indicator dyes are lipophilic cations accumulated by mitochondria in proportion to {DeltaPsi}. Upon accumulation, all three dyes exhibit a red shift in both their absorption and fluorescence emission spectra. The fluorescence intensity is quenched when the dyes are accumulated by mitochondria. These properties have been used to develop a method to dynamically monitor {DeltaPsi} of isolated rat heart mitochondria using a ratio fluorescence approach. All three dyes bound to the inner and outer aspects of the inner mitochondrial membrane and, as a result, were accumulated by mitochondria in a greater quantity than predicted by the Nernst equation. Binding to mitochondria was temperature-dependent and the degree of binding was in the order of {TMRE} {\textgreater} R123 {\textgreater} {TMRM}. The internal and external partition coefficients for binding were determined to correct for binding in the calculation of {DeltaPsi}. All three dyes suppressed mitochondrial respiratory control to some extent. Inhibition of respiration was greatest with {TMRE}, followed by R123 and {TMRM}. When used at low concentrations, {TMRM} did not suppress respiration. The use of these dyes and ratio fluorescence techniques affords a simple method for measurement of {DeltaPsi} of isolated mitochondria. We also applied this approach to the isolated perfused heart to determine whether {DeltaPsi} could be monitored in an intact tissue. Wavelength scanning of the surface fluorescence of the heart under various conditions after accumulation of {TMRM} indicated that the mitochondrial matrix-induced wavelength shift of {TMRM} also occurs in the heart cytosol, eliminating the use of this approach in the intact heart.},

Mitochondria were attached to coverslips and perfused with K+-based buffer containing 20 μM {EDTA}, supplemented with malate and glutamate, and rhodamine 123 for ΔΨm determination. ΔΨm fluctuations were triggered by mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake since they were inhibited by both ruthenium red, a Ca2+-uniporter blocker, and by high concentrations of {EGTA}. A very low concentration of Ca2+ (∼30 {nM}) was required to initiate the fluctuations. Both {ATP} and {ADP} reversibly inhibited ΔΨm fluctuations, with maximal effects occurring at 100{μM}. The effect of nucleotides could not be explained by the reversed mode of mitochondrial {ATP}-synthase, since oligomycin was not effective and nonhydrolysable analogs of {ATP} and {ADP} did not stop the fluctuations. The effects of adenine nucleotides were abolished by blockade of the adenine nucleotide translocator with carboxyatractyloside, but were insensitive to another inhibitor, bongkrekic acid. {ATP}-sensitive K+-channels are not involved in the mechanism of ΔΨm fluctuations, since the inhibitor 5-hydroxydecanoate or the activator diazoxide did not affect dynamics of ΔΨm. We suggest ΔΨm fluctuations in brain mitochondria are not spontaneous, but are triggered by Ca2+ and are modulated by adenine nucleotides, possibly from the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane.},

Corrected values for enzymatic decarboxylation could be obtained by subtracting spontaneous decarboxylation rates from rates obtained in the presence of mitochondria. At higher peroxide concentrations (\&gt;200 μM), reaction product accumulates (acetoacetate) to levels which may have regulatory effects on mitochondrial metabolism. The divalent cations, Ca2+ and Mg2+, both accelerate spontaneous peroxide-induced pyruvate decarboxylation while other components of the assay medium had an inhibitory effect on the reaction.

Mathematical modeling analysis of in vivo 13C turnover experiments from the C4 carbons of glutamate and glutamine are consistent with: (i) the glutamine cycle being the major cerebral metabolic route supporting glutamatergic neurotransmission, (ii) glial glutamine synthesis being stoichiometrically coupled to glycolytic {ATP} production, (iii) glutamine serving as the main precursor of neurotransmitter glutamate and (iv) glutamatergic neurotransmission being supported by lactate oxidation in the neurons in a process accounting for 60–80\% of the energy derived from glucose catabolism. However, more recent experimental approaches using inhibitors of the glial tricarboxylic acid ({TCA}) cycle (trifluoroacetic acid, {TFA}) or of glutamine synthase (methionine sulfoximine, {MSO}) reveal that a considerable portion of the energy required to support glutamine synthesis is derived from the oxidative metabolism of glucose in the astroglia and that a significant amount of the neurotransmitter glutamate is produced from neuronal glucose or lactate rather than from glial glutamine. Moreover, a redox switch has been proposed that allows the neurons to use either glucose or lactate as substrates for oxidation, depending on the relative availability of these fuels under resting or activation conditions, respectively. Together, these results suggest that the coupling mechanisms between neuronal and glial metabolism are more complex than initially envisioned.},

	abstract = {The products of the reactions of mitochondrial 2-oxo acids with hydrogen peroxide and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tert-{BuOOH}) were studied in a chemical system and in rat liver mitochondria. It was found by {HPLC} that the decarboxylation of α-ketoglutarate ({KGL}), pyruvate ({PYR}), and oxaloacetate ({OA}) by both oxidants results in the formation of succinate, acetate, and malonate, respectively. The two latter products do not metabolize in rat liver mitochondria, whereas succinate is actively oxidized, and its nonenzymatic formation from {KGL} may shunt the tricarboxylic acid ({TCA}) cycle upon inactivation of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase ({KGDH}) under oxidative stress, which is inherent in many diseases and aging. The occurrence of nonenzymatic oxidation of {KGL} in mitochondria was established by an increase in the {CO}2 and succinate levels in the presence of the oxidants and inhibitors of enzymatic oxidation. H2O2 and menadione as an inductor of reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) caused the formation of {CO}2 in the presence of sodium azide and the production of succinate, fumarate, and malate in the presence of rotenone. These substrates were also formed from {KGL} when mitochondria were incubated with tert-{BuOOH} at concentrations that completely inhibit {KGDH}. The nonenzymatic oxidation of {KGL} can support the {TCA} cycle under oxidative stress, provided that {KGL} is supplied via transamination. This is supported by the finding that the strong oxidant such as tert-{BuOOH} did not impair respiration and its sensitivity to the transaminase inhibitor aminooxyacetate when glutamate and malate were used as substrates. The appearance of two products, {KGL} and fumarate, also favors the involvement of transamination. Thus, upon oxidative stress, nonenzymatic decarboxylation of {KGL} and transamination switch the {TCA} cycle to the formation and oxidation of succinate.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate that alpha-ketoacids reduce and, in some instances, abrogate menadione-induced {DNA} damage and cytotoxicity in the human breast cancer cell line, {MCF}7. We confirm that alpha-ketoacids quench the copious amounts of H2O2 generated by menadione while these alpha-ketoacids undergo nonenzymatic oxidative decarboxylation; our data thus support enhanced H2O2 production as an important pathway for menadione-induced {DNA} damage and cytotoxicity. We also demonstrate that alpha-ketoacids scavenge H2O2 generated by mitochondria and microsomes when these organelles are exposed to menadione; additionally, alpha-ketoacids protect oxidant-vulnerable enzymes against functional impairment induced by H2O2. Finally, we provide the first in vivo demonstration that acute elevations in concentrations of alpha-ketoacids in rat tissues and urine scavenge H2O2. We conclude that enhanced H2O2 production is a major pathway for menadione-induced {DNA} damage and cytotoxicity and that the diverse alpha-ketoacids present within the cell must be considered, along with glutathione peroxidase and catalase, as part of the intracellular antioxidant defense mechanisms that regulate the ambient levels of H2O2.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is suspected to be involved in numerous brain pathologies such as neurodegenerative diseases or in acute injury such as ischemia or trauma. In this study, we examined the ability of pyruvate to improve the survival of cultured striatal neurons exposed for 30 min to H2O2, as estimated 24 hr later by the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]−2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide assay. Pyruvate strongly protected neurons against both H2O2 added to the external medium and H2O2 endogenously produced through the redox cycling of the experimental quinone menadione. The neuroprotective effect of pyruvate appeared to result rather from the ability of α-ketoacids to undergo nonenzymatic decarboxylation in the presence of H2O2 than from an improvement of energy metabolism. Indeed, several other α-ketoacids, including α-ketobutyrate, which is not an energy substrate, reproduced the neuroprotective effect of pyruvate. In contrast, lactate, a neuronal energy substrate, did not protect neurons from H2O2. Optimal neuroprotection was achieved with relatively low concentrations of pyruvate (≤1 mm), whereas at high concentration (10 mm) pyruvate was ineffective. This paradox could result from the cytosolic acidification induced by the cotransport of pyruvate and protons into neurons. Indeed, cytosolic acidification both enhanced the H2O2-induced neurotoxicity and decreased the rate of pyruvate decarboxylation by H2O2. Together, these results indicate that pyruvate efficiently protects neurons against both exogenous and endogenous H2O2. Its low toxicity and its capacity to cross the blood–brain barrier open a new therapeutic perspective in brain pathologies in which H2O2is involved.},

We show here for the first time that p42IP4 is localized in mitochondria, isolated from rat brain and from cells transfected with p42IP4. In rat brain mitochondria we additionally found interaction of p42IP4 with 2′, 3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase and α-tubulin by pull-down binding assay and by immunoprecipitation. In mitochondria from Chinese hamster ovary cells, p42IP4 is predominantly associated with the intermembrane space and the inner membrane. This localization of p42IP4 indicates that p42IP4 might have a still unknown mitochondrial function. We studied whether p42IP4 is involved in Ca2+-induced permeability transition pore opening, which is important in mitochondrial events leading to programmed cell death. We used mouse neuroblastoma cells as a model for the functional studies of p42IP4 in mitochondria. In mitochondria isolated from p42IP4-transfected mouse neuroblastoma cells, over-expression of p42IP4 significantly decreased Ca2+ capacity and lag time for Ca2+ retention. Thus, we suggest that p42IP4 is involved in the regulation of Ca2+ transport in mitochondria. We propose that p42IP4 promotes Ca2+-induced permeability transition pore opening and thus destabilizes mitochondria.},

Here, we studied whether {PBR} is involved in Ca2+-induced permeability transition pore ({PTP}) opening in isolated rat brain mitochondria ({RBM}). {PTP} opening is important in mitochondrial events leading to programmed cell death. Immunoblots revealed a single 18\&\#xa0;{kDa} anti-{PBR} antibody-immunoreactive band in purified {RBM}. Adenine nucleotide transporter, a key {PTP} component, was found in the {PBR}-immunoprecipitate. In isolated intact {RBM}, addition of a specific anti-{PBR} antibody [H. Li, Z. Yao, B. Degenhardt, G. Teper, V.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 98 (2001) 1267â€“1272] delayed Ca2+-induced dissipation of membrane potential (Ïˆm) and diminished cyclosporine A-sensitive Ca2+ efflux, which are both indicative for the suppression of {PTP} opening. Moreover, anti-{PBR} antibody caused partial retention of Ca2+ in the mitochondrial matrix in spite of Ïˆm dissipation, and reduced activation of respiratory rate at Ca2+-induced {PTP} opening. A release of pro-apoptotic factors, {AIF} and cytochrome c, from {RBM} was shown at threshold Ca2+ load. Anti-{PBR} antibody blocked the release of {AIF} but did not affect the cytochrome c release. Addition of {ATP} was able to initiate {PTP} closing, associated with Ïˆm restoration and Ca2+ re-accumulation. At the same time mitochondrial protein phosphorylation (incorporation of 32P from [Î³-32P]{ATP}) occurred and anti-{PBR} antibody was able to inhibit phosphorylation of these proteins. The endogenous {PBR} ligand, protoporphyrin {IX}, facilitated {PTP} opening and phosphorylation of the mitochondrial proteins, thus, inducing effects opposite to anti-{PBR} antibody. This study provides evidence for {PBR} involvement in {PTP} opening, controlling the Ca2+-induced Ca2+ efflux, and {AIF} release from mitochondria, important stages of initiation of programmed cell death.},

However, it is now recognized that H(2)S may serve as a gaseous mediator that is endogenously produced to influence biological functions in mammalian. Together with nitric oxide and carbon monoxide, it forms the group of mediators that has been termed the "gasotransmitters." The past decade has seen an exponential growth of scientific interest in the physiological and pathological significance of H(2)S especially with respect to its role in the central nervous system and the cardiovascular system. In the central nervous system, H(2)S facilitates long-term potentiation and regulates intracellular calcium concentration and {pH} level in brain cells. Intriguingly, H(2)S produces antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects that may have relevance to neurodegenerative disorders. Abnormal generation and metabolism of H(2)S have been reported in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and recurrent febrile seizure. Exogenously applied H(2)S is demonstrated to have value for the treatment of febrile seizure and Parkinson's disease. This article presents an overview of current knowledge of H(2)S in relation to brain functions, with a special emphasis on its neuroprotective effects and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms.},

	abstract = {The anticonvulsant activity of inhibitors of monoamine oxidase ({MAO}) was reported early after the development of irreversible {MAO} inhibitors such as tranylcypromine, but was never clinically used because of the adverse effects of these compounds. The more recently developed reversible {MAO} inhibitors with selectivity for either the {MAO}-A or {MAO}-B isoenzyme forms have not been studied extensively in animal models of epilepsy, so it is not known which type of {MAO} inhibitor is particularly effective in this respect. We compared the following drugs in the kindling model of epilepsy: 1) l-deprenyl (selegiline), i.e., an irreversible inhibitor of {MAO}-B, which, however, also inhibits {MAO}-A at higher doses, 2) the novel reversible {MAO}-B inhibitor {LU} 53439 (3,4-dimethyl-7-(2-isopropyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-5-yl)-methoxy-coumarin), which is much more selective for {MAO}-B than l-deprenyl, 3) the novel reversible and highly selective {MAO}-A inhibitor {LU} 43839 (esuprone; 7-hydroxy-3,4-dimethylcoumarin ethanesulfonate), and 4) the irreversible nonselective {MAO} inhibitor tranylcypromine. Esuprone proved to be an effective anticonvulsant in the kindling model with a similar potency as l-deprenyl. In contrast to esuprone and l-deprenyl, the selective {MAO}-B inhibitor {LU} 53439 was not effective in the kindling model; this substantiates the previous notion that the anticonvulsant activity ofl-deprenyl is not related to {MAO}-B inhibition, but to other effects of this drug, such as inhibition of {MAO}-A. Drugs inhibiting both {MAO}-A and {MAO}-B to a similar extent (tranylcypromine) or combinations of selective {MAO}-A and {MAO}-B inhibitors (esuprone plus {LU} 53439) had no advantage over {MAO}-A inhibition alone, but were less well tolerated. The data thus suggest that selective {MAO}-A inhibitors such as esuprone may be an interesting new approach for the treatment of epilepsy.},

	abstract = {Glucose is the primary fuel for brain function and determining the kinetics of cerebral glucose transport and utilization is critical for quantifying cerebral energy metabolism. The kinetic parameters of cerebral glucose transport, K(M)(t) and V(max)(t), in humans have so far been obtained by measuring steady-state brain glucose levels by proton ((1)H) {NMR} as a function of plasma glucose levels and fitting steady-state models to these data. Extraction of the kinetic parameters for cerebral glucose transport necessitated assuming a constant cerebral metabolic rate of glucose ({CMR}(glc)) obtained from other tracer studies, such as (13)C {NMR}. Here we present new methodology to simultaneously obtain kinetic parameters for glucose transport and utilization in the human brain by fitting both dynamic and steady-state (1)H {NMR} data with a reversible, non-steady-state Michaelis-Menten model. Dynamic data were obtained by measuring brain and plasma glucose time courses during glucose infusions to raise and maintain plasma concentration at {\textasciitilde}17 mmol/l for {\textasciitilde}2 hours in 5 healthy volunteers. Steady-state brain vs. plasma glucose concentrations were taken from literature and the steady-state portions of data from the 5 volunteers. In addition to providing simultaneous measurements of glucose transport and utilization and obviating assumptions for constant {CMR}(glc), this methodology does not necessitate infusions of expensive or radioactive tracers. Using this new methodology, we found that the maximum transport capacity for glucose through the blood-brain barrier was nearly two-fold higher than maximum cerebral glucose utilization. The glucose transport and utilization parameters were consistent with previously published values for human brain.},

This reaction has been frequently employed for measurements of low concentrations of H(2)O(2) in biological samples. In the current study, we show that alternative peroxidase substrates, such as p-hydroquinone, acetaminophen, anticancer mitoxantrone, and ametantrone, inhibit {AR} oxidation by consuming H(2)O(2) in a competitive process. In contrast, the anthracycline agents doxorubicin, daunorubicin, and 5-iminodaunorubicin are markedly less efficient as competitors in these reactions, as is salicylic acid. When [H(2)O(2)]{\textgreater}[{AR}], the generated resorufin was oxidized by {HRP} and H(2)O(2). In the presence of anthracyclines, this process was inhibited and occurred with a lag time, the duration of which depended on the concentration of anthracycline. We propose that the mechanism of this inhibition is due to the antioxidant activity of anthracyclines involving the reduction of the resorufin-derived phenoxyl radical by the drugs' hydroquinone moiety back to resorufin. In addition to {HRP}, lactoperoxidase, myeloperoxidase, and {HL}-60 cells, naturally rich in myeloperoxidase, also supported these reactions. Results of this study suggest that extra caution is needed when using {AR} to measure cellular H(2)O(2) in the presence of alternative peroxidase substrates. They also demonstrate that the anticancer anthracyclines may function as antioxidants.},

The sulphurated tripeptide glutathione acts as a powerful antioxidant agent within the nervous system. Recent in vitro studies suggest that the cellular redox status might influence the mechanisms involved in synaptic plasticity. It is not known, however, how glutathione depletion might affect {LTP}. In the present study, we evaluated the input–output relationships, {LTP}, and paired-pulse interactions in rats with low glutathione levels induced by systemic injection of diethylmaleate. Our results in anesthetized rats show that the basic synaptic transmission between the perforant pathway and the dentate gyrus granule cells was not affected by glutathione depletion. However, in the same synapses it was not possible to induce prolonged changes in synaptic efficacy ({LTP}). Paired-pulse facilitation was also absent in the treated animals, suggesting an impairment of short-term synaptic interactions. These findings indicate that low content of glutathione can impair short-term and long-term mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and stress the importance of the redox balance in the normal function of brain circuitry.

In the neurodestructive mode, {NO}· reacts with superoxide anion (O2·−) to form peroxynitrite ({ONOO}−), which leads to neuronal injury. In contrast, the reaction of the {NO} group with cysteine sulfhydryls on the {NMDA} receptor leads to a decrease in receptor/channel activity, avoidance of excessive Ca2+ entry, and thus neuroprotection. Site-directed mutagenesis of recombinant {NMDA} receptor subunits has recently increased our knowledge of such redox modulation by {NO}. Transfer of the {NO} group to cysteine sulfhydryls on the {NMDA} receptor or other proteins, known as S-nitrosylation, is becoming recognized as a ubiquitous regulatory reaction, akin to phosphorylation, and represents a form of redox modulation in diverse tissues including the brain.},

Although these pathways include, among others, cholinergic and {GABAergic} fibers innervating the hippocampus, research has essentially been oriented towards the role of their cholinergic component. Recently, a few studies investigated the role of {GABAergic} septohippocampal projections. These only focused on almost immediate or recent memory and yielded discrepant results. {GABAergic} lesions impaired learning or had no effects. Given the role of the hippocampus in memory consolidation and the potential modulatory influence of the septum on hippocampal function, it is relevant to study the role of the septohippocampal interface in memory stabilization. We performed investigations with relatively selective lesions of {GABAergic} (using oxerin-saporin) or/and cholinergic (using 192 {IgG}-saporin) medial septum/vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca ({MS}/{vDBB}) neurons in rats, and assessed acquisition of a spatial memory and its subsequent recall in the water maze. Following a 6-day training phase during which all groups improved performance to comparable levels, retention was tested 1, 5, or 25 days later. At the 1-day delay, all groups performed above chance and did not differ significantly among each other. At the 5-day delay, only rats with {GABAergic} or combined lesions exhibited a retention deficit. At the 25-day delay, all three lesion groups performed at chance level; in these groups, performance was significantly lower than that found in sham-operated rats. Immunochemical and histochemical verifications of the lesion extent/selectivity showed extensive {GABAergic} damage after intraseptal orexin-saporin infusions or cholinergic damage after 192 {IgG}-saporin infusions, with relatively limited damage to the other neurotransmitter system. Our data show that {GABAergic} and cholinergic septohippocampal neurons both contribute to memory stabilization, and could do so in a sequential way: {GABAergic} processes could be engaged at an earlier stage than cholinergic ones during system consolidation of a spatial memory. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Using a combination of {DNA} microarray and quantitative {PCR} methods, we found that the three subregions have relatively similar expression patterns of ionotropic receptors for classical neurotransmitters. Expression of ionotropic receptors for glutamate and {GABA} represents more than 90\% of all ionotropic receptors for classical neurotransmitters, and the expression ratio between ionotropic receptors for glutamate and {GABA} is constant (1.2:1-1.6:1) in each subregion. Meanwhile, the three subregions have different expression patterns of neuropeptide receptors. Furthermore, there are asymmetric expression patterns between neuropeptides and their receptors. Expression of Cck, Npy, Sst, and Penk1 represents 90\% of neuropeptides derived locally in the hippocampus, whereas expression of these four neuropeptide receptors accounts for 50\% of G protein-coupled receptors for neuropeptides. We propose that {CA}1, {CA}3, and {DG} have different modalities based on the ligand-receptor system, particularly the "neuropeptidergic system."

Medial septal neuronal populations display heterogeneous firing patterns. In addition, some of these populations degenerate during age-related disorders (e.g. cholinergic neurons). Thus, it is particularly important to examine the intrinsic properties of theses neurons in order to create new agents that effectively modulate hippocampal excitability and enhance memory processes. Here, we have examined the properties of voltage-gated, K(+) currents in electrophysiologically-identified neurons. These neurons were taken from young rat brain slices containing the {MS}/{DB} complex. Whole-cell, patch recordings of outward currents were obtained from slow firing, fast-spiking, regular-firing and burst-firing neurons. Slow firing neurons showed depolarization-activated K(+) current peaks and densities larger than in other neuronal subtypes. Slow firing total current exhibited an inactivating A-type current component that activates at subthreshold depolarization and was reliably blocked by high concentrations of 4-{AP}. In addition, slow firing neurons expressed a low-threshold delayed rectifier K(+) current component with slow inactivation and intermediate sensitivity to tetraethylammonium. Fast-spiking neurons exhibited the smaller I(K) and I(A) current densities. Burst and regular firing neurons displayed an intermediate firing phenotype with I(K) and I(A) current densities that were larger than the ones observed in fast-spiking neurons but smaller than the ones observed in slow-firing neurons. In addition, the prevalence of each current differed among electrophysiological groups with slow firing and regular firing neurons expressing mostly I(A) and fast spiking and bursting neurons exhibiting mostly delayer rectifier K(+) currents with only minimal contributions of the I(A). The pharmacological or genetic modulations of these currents constitute an important target for the treatment of age-related disorders.},

Despite this, the factors influencing glutamate neurotoxicity in vivo are poorly understood, and the role of glutamate as a neurotoxin in vivo is contested. By using a microdialysis probe to deliver glutamate to the normal rat cortex, we have devised a reproducible model of peracute 'excitotoxic' damage. We have demonstrated that concentrations of over 20 {mM} glutamate in the perfusate kill neurons in the intact brain in less than 90 min -20 to 200 times more than that required for toxicity in mixed cell culture. The histological and ultrastructural features of the glutamate lesion are very similar to those of acute ischaemia, although their development is much more rapid after glutamate. True extracellular glutamate concentrations estimated from microdialysis studies (about 4 {mM}) are not far from our results. The reproducible quantifiable nature of the glutamate lesions in this model make it well suited to study the factors affecting the excitotoxic process in vivo.},

The nature of specific signal initiators, nuclear translocators and effectors has become increasingly clear, and supports the idea that the nucleus is able to make sense of a surprising amount of fast synaptic information through intricate biochemical mechanisms. Information transfer to the nucleus can be conveyed by physical translocation of messengers at various stages within the multiple signal transduction cascades that are set in motion by a Ca2+ rise near the surface membrane. The key role of synapse-to-nucleus signaling in circadian rhythms, long-term memory, and neuronal survival sheds light on the logical underpinning of these signaling mechanisms.},

Medial septal neurons were simultaneously recorded with hippocampal field potentials to investigate the septo-hippocampal function in the pilocarpine model of chronic epilepsy. The theta rhythm from chronically epileptic rats had lower amplitude (20\% less) and higher frequency than controls (from 3.38 to 4.25 Hz), suggesting that both generator and pacemaker structures are affected during the epileptic process. At the cellular level, the group of rhythmically bursting firing medial septal neurons, in the epileptic animals, significantly and chronically increased their firing rates in relation to controls (from 13.86 to 29.14 spikes/s). Peristimulus histograms performed around hippocampal sharp waves showed that all high-frequency firing neurons, including rhythmically bursting neurons and most slow firing neurons, decreased firing rates immediately after hippocampal epileptic discharges. Thus inhibitory hippocampo-septal influences prevail during hippocampal epileptic discharges. The occurrence of epileptic discharges was reduced 86-97\% of the number observed during spontaneous theta and theta induced by sensory (tail pinch) or chemical stimulation (carbachol), suggesting that the presence of the theta state regardless of how it was produced was responsible for the reduction in epileptic discharge frequency. The understanding of the theta rhythm "anti-epileptic" effect at the cellular and molecular levels may result in novel therapeutic approaches dedicated to protect the brain against abnormal excitability states.},

	abstract = {Nuclei of the medial septum/diagonal band region of the mammalian forebrain contain neurons that give rise to the septohippocampal pathway, which has separate cholinergic and {GABAergic} components. This pathway is known to influence hippocampal-dependent memory and learning processes, but the precise role of each component is unclear. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that fast-firing, non-bursting medial septum/diagonal band neurons are {GABAergic}. We used brain slice preparations from young adult guinea-pigs and rats, or from weanling rats, to perform current-clamp recordings from medial septum/diagonal band neurons. Recorded neurons were injected with biocytin for subsequent visualization with fluorescent avidin, and then hybridized with a 35S-labeled riboprobe for glutamate decarboxylase-67 messenger {RNA}. As a positive control, guinea-pig cerebellar Purkinje cells were labeled and hybridized with the riboprobe. As expected, labeled Purkinje cells were glutamate decarboxylase-67 messenger {RNA} positive. Slow-firing, cholinergic (choline acetyltransferase-positive) guinea-pig medial septum/diagonal band neurons were glutamate decarboxylase-67 messenger {RNA} negative. Contrary to our hypothesis, of the guinea-pig neurons, only three of 11 fast-firing neurons were glutamate decarboxylase-67 positive. Of the rat medial septum/diagonal band neurons, three of four were positive for glutamate decarboxylase-67 messenger {RNA}. These data suggest that fast-firing, non-bursting neurons of the medial septum/diagonal band, as sampled by sharp-electrode intracellular recordings in brain slices, may be a heterogeneous group of neurons, some of which are {GABAergic}. Together with recent data demonstrating the presence of another {GABAergic} marker, parvalbumin, in fast-firing septal neurons, we conclude that {GABAergic} septohippocampal neurons include a population of fast-firing, non-bursting neurons. The influence of these neurons on the hippocampus is likely to occur on a shorter time-scale and over a wider range of firing frequencies as compared to slowly firing cholinergic septohippocampal neurons.},

The nature of Ih contribution to various neuronal oscillations is far from uniform however, and the proper evaluation of the role of Ih in each particular structure requires in situ investigations in the intact brain. In this study we tested the effect of Ih blockade in the medial septum on hippocampal theta rhythm in anaesthetized and freely behaving rats. We could not confirm the recent report of elimination of theta by septal injection of {ZD}7288 [C. Xu et al. (2004) Eur. J. Neurosci., 19, 2299-2309]; the observed effects were more subtle and more specific. We found that Ih blockade in the medial septum substantially decreased the frequency of hippocampal oscillations without changing the context in which theta occurred, i.e. specific behaviours in freely moving rats and spontaneous switching and brainstem stimulation under anaesthesia. Septal injection of {ZD}7288 eliminated atropine-resistant theta elicited by high intensity electrical stimulation of the reticular formation in anaesthetized rats but was ineffective in combination with the muscarinic agonist, carbachol. Thus, functional Ih was necessary for the septum to generate or transmit high frequency theta rhythm elicited by strong ascending activation, whereas low frequency theta persisted after Ih blockade. These results suggest that Ih plays a specific role in septal theta generation by promoting fast oscillations during exploratory behaviour and rapid eye movement sleep.},

The {SUM} is, however, reciprocally connected to the septohippocampal system and there is strong evidence that both septum and {SUM} are capable of generating theta rhythmic activity. The present study examined the possible role of a descending rhythmic input to the {SUM} using simultaneously recorded hippocampal {EEG} and {SUM} neuronal activity in anesthetized rats. Fourier based phase analysis was performed on recordings in which fast theta rhythmic activity was elicited by tail pinch and in which a slower theta rhythm persisted after cessation of the sensory stimulus. It was found that the firing of a subpopulation of {SUM} neurons followed the hippocampal theta waves with a constant time delay, rather than a constant phase, suggesting that during deceleration associated with a shift from sensory-elicited theta to spontaneous theta rhythm they followed a descending rhythmic input, most likely from the medial septum. Neurons of a second group, which fired at the hippocampal theta peaks, did not show such relationship demonstrating heterogeneity in the population of rhythmic {SUM} neurons and their possible roles in theta generation. Combined with previous studies focusing on the role of the ascending theta drive from the {SUM}, these results demonstrate dynamic bidirectional coupling between subcortical theta generators. Thus, during certain states, rhythmically firing {SUM} neurons lead the septal theta oscillator, in others the direction may reverse and {SUM} follows a theta drive of septal origin.},

	abstract = {The medial septum ({MS}) is an indispensable component of the subcortical network which synchronizes the hippocampus at theta frequency during specific stages of information processing. {GABAergic} neurons exhibiting highly regular firing coupled to the hippocampal theta rhythm are thought to form the core of the {MS} rhythm-generating network. In recent studies the hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated non-selective cation ({HCN}) channel was shown to participate in theta synchronization of the medial septum. Here, we tested the hypothesis that {HCN} channel expression correlates with theta modulated firing behaviour of {MS} neurons by a combined anatomical and electrophysiological approach. {HCN}-expressing neurons represented a subpopulation of {GABAergic} cells in the {MS} partly overlapping with parvalbumin ({PV})-containing neurons. Rhythmic firing in the theta frequency range was characteristic of all {HCN}-expressing neurons. In contrast, only a minority of {HCN}-negative cells displayed theta related activity. All {HCN} cells had tight phase coupling to hippocampal theta waves. As a group, {PV}-expressing {HCN} neurons had a marked bimodal phase distribution, whereas {PV}-immunonegative {HCN} neurons did not show group-level phase preference despite significant individual phase coupling. Microiontophoretic blockade of {HCN} channels resulted in the reduction of discharge frequency, but theta rhythmic firing was perturbed only in a few cases. Our data imply that {HCN}-expressing {GABAergic} neurons provide rhythmic drive in all phases of the hippocampal theta activity. In most {MS} theta cells rhythm genesis is apparently determined by interactions at the level of the network rather than by the pacemaking property of {HCN} channels alone.},

	abstract = {The medial septum/diagonal band complex is composed predominantly of cholinergic and {GABAergic} neurons, and it projects to the hippocampal formation. A proportion of the {GABAergic} neurons contain parvalbumin, a calcium-binding protein that has previously been localized in fast-spiking, non-accommodating {GABAergic} neurons in the cerebral cortex and neostriatum. The aim of the present study was to determine whether parvalbumin is localized preferentially in a similar electrophysiological class of neuron in the medial septum/diagonal band complex. The study was carried out using in vitro intracellular recording, intracellular biocytin filling and parvalbumin immunocytochemistry. Three main classes of neurons were identified according to standard criteria: burst-firing, slow-firing and fast-firing neuronal populations. The fast-firing neurons were subdivided into two subpopulations based on whether or not they displayed accommodation. The fast-spiking, non-accommodating cells were furthermore found to be spontaneously active at resting potentials, and to possess action potentials of significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) shorter duration (half width: 0.61 +/- 0.12 ms) than those of the regular-spiking, accommodating neurons (1.0 +/- 0.34 ms). Of the neurons that were successfully filled with biocytin and processed for parvalbumin immunoreactivity, 82\% of the fast-spiking, non-accommodating cells possessed parvalbumin immunoreactivity, while none of the regular-spiking, accommodating neurons were found to be immunoreactive for parvalbumin. The slow-firing neurons, shown previously to be cholinergic, did not stain for parvalbumin immunoreactivity, in agreement with studies showing parvalbumin to be localized solely in {GABAergic} neurons in the medial septum/diagonal band complex. In conclusion, these findings suggest the presence of a previously uncharacterized population of neurons in the medial septum/diagonal band complex that generate high-frequency, non-adaptive discharge. This property correlates with the localization of parvalbumin in these neurons, which suggests that parvalbumin fulfils the same role in the medial septum/diagonal band complex that it does in other parts of the brain. The fast-spiking neurons in the medial septum/diagonal band complex may play an essential role in the {GABAergic} influence of the septum on the hippocampal formation.},

Double-labelling experiments revealed that these four antigen-containing cells formed distinct dorsoventrally running lamellae overlayed on top of each other similar to onion leaves. There was only a slight overlapping of the various cell groups. None of the four antigens were co-localized in the same cells. The lamella occupied by calretinin-positive neurons is situated at the border of the medial septum and the intermediolateral septal nucleus, and shows some overlap with the area occupied by cholinergic neurons. Retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase from the hippocampus combined with immunostaining for calretinin revealed that calretinin-containing neurons do not participate in the septohippocampal projection. The lack of projection to the amygdala was also confirmed. Thus, calretinin-containing neurons represent a distinct cell group in the medial septal region, which either projects to subcortical areas, or may function as interneurons relaying hippocampal feedback to the medial septal projection neurons.},

Our data showed that the conditioning treatments with intra-medial septum injection of different doses of histamine (0.5-15 microg/rat) induced a significant {CPP} for the drug-associated place. Using a 3-day schedule of conditioning, it was found that the histamine H1 receptor antagonist, pyrilamine (10 and 15 microg/rat, intra-medial septum) also induced a significant place preference. In addition, pyrilamine inhibited the histamine (7.5 microg/rat)-induced place preference. Intra-medial septum administration of the histamine H2 receptor antagonist, ranitidine (5-15 microg/rat) alone or in combination with histamine did not produce a significant place preference or place aversion. On the other hand, intra-medial septum administration of the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, {SCH} 233390 (0.5, 0.75 and 1 microg/rat) inhibited the histamine (7.5 microg/rat) or pyrilamine (15 microg/rat)-induced place preference in a dose-dependent manner, but no effect was observed for the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, sulpiride on the histamine or pyrilamine response. The administration of histamine (2.5-15 microg/rat) or pyrilamine (10 and 15 microg/rat) during acquisition increased locomotor activity of the animals on the testing days. The results suggest that histaminergic receptors of the medial septum may be involved in {CPP} and thus it is postulated that dopamine D1 receptors may play an important role in this effect.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Recent studies have pointed out the involvement of the basal forebrain gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated system in mediating the effects of general anesthesia. In this study, the authors asked whether the basal forebrain cholinergic system is also involved in mediating the effects of general anesthetics such as propofol.


{METHODS}

Cholinergic lesions were produced by administration of the selective immunotoxin 192 immunoglobulin G-saporin into the lateral ventricles, the medial septum, or the nucleus basalis magnocellularis. The anesthetic potency of propofol was determined using an anesthetic score with a crossover counterbalanced design. Animals were given intraperitoneal propofol (25 or 50 mg/kg) repeatedly every 15 min to set up a subanesthetic (low-dose) or anesthetic (high-dose) state. The anesthetic score was assessed for each cumulative dose. Control of the cholinergic depletion was performed using histochemical acetylcholinesterase staining on brain slices.


{RESULTS}

A shift from a subanesthetic state to an anesthetic state was observed mainly in the rats with the immunotoxin injected into the lateral ventricles or the medial septum and vertical diagonal band of Broca, compared with controls. In those rats, the density of acetylcholinesterase reaction products was normal in the striatum and the thalamus, but reduced in the cortex and the hippocampus.


{CONCLUSION}

The anesthetic potency of propofol was increased in all rats with hippocampal lesions, whatever the injection sites, compared with controls. These results demonstrate that a cholinergic dysfunction in the basal forebrain potentiates the anesthetic effects of propofol.},

	abstract = {Cholinergic systems were linked to cognitive processes like attention and memory. Other neurotransmitter systems having minor influence on cognitive functions - as shown by the weakness of the effects of their selective lesions - modulate cholinergic functions. The serotonergic system is such a system. Conjoined functional changes in cholinergic and serotonergic systems may have marked cognitive consequences [Cassel {JC}, Jeltsch H. Serotoninergic modulation of cholinergic function in the central nervous system: cognitive implications. Neuroscience 1995;69(1):1-41; Steckler T, Sahgal A. The role of serotoninergic-cholinergic interactions in the mediation of cognitive behaviour. Behav Brain Res 1995;67:165-99]. A crucial issue in that concern is the identification of the neuroanatomical and neuropharmacological substrates where functional effects of serotonergic/cholinergic interactions originate. Approaches relying on lesions and intracerebral cell grafting, on systemic drug-cocktail injections, or even on intracerebral drug infusions represent the main avenues on which our knowledge about the role of serotonergic/cholinergic interactions has progressed. The present review will visit some of these avenues and discuss their contribution to what is currently known on the potential or established implication(s) into memory functions of serotonergic/cholinergic interactions. It will then focus on a brain region and a neuropharmacological substrate that have been poorly studied as regards serotonergic modulation of memory functions, namely the medial septum and its 5-{HT}(1A) receptors. Based on recent findings of our laboratory, we suggest that these receptors, located on both cholinergic and {GABAergic} septal neurons, take part in a mechanism that controls encoding, to some extent consolidation, but not retrieval, of hippocampal-dependent memories. This control, however, does not occur by the way of an exclusive action of serotonin on cholinergic neurons.},

Here we use in vivo juxtacellular recording and filling in the medial septum followed by immunocytochemical identification of the recorded cells containing parvalbumin to determine their firing pattern, phase relationship with hippocampal theta, morphology, and to thereby reveal their involvement in the generation of hippocampal theta activity. We have demonstrated that {GABAergic} medial septal neurons form two distinct populations exhibiting highly regular bursting activity that is tightly coupled to either the trough (178 degrees ) or the peak (330 degrees ) of hippocampal theta waves. Additionally, different types of bursting as well as nonbursting activity patterns were also observed. The morphological reconstruction of theta-bursting neurons revealed extensive axon arbors of these cells with numerous local collaterals establishing symmetrical synapses; thus, synchrony among the septal pacemaker units may be brought about by their recurrent collateral interactions. Long projecting axons could also be found running dorsally toward the hippocampus and ventrally in the direction of basal forebrain regions. We conclude that {GABAergic} neurons in the medial septum, which are known to selectively innervate hippocampal interneurons, are in a position to induce rhythmic disinhibition in the hippocampus and other theta-related subcortical areas at two different phases of hippocampal theta.},

To test this hypothesis, the present experiments determined whether septal infusions of the selective {HCN} channel blocker {ZD}7288 would impair performance on two memory tasks that involve the septo-hippocampal system: spontaneous alternation ({SA}) and continuous multiple inhibitory avoidance ({CMIA}). Fifteen minutes prior to assessing {SA} or {CMIA}, different groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats were given septal infusions of saline or {ZD}7288 (0.2, 0.6 or 1.5 microg/0.5 micro1). Septal infusions of {ZD}7288 impaired {SA} in a dose-dependent manner; the same infusions did not affect {CMIA} acquisition or retention. These results appear to be the first demonstration that {HCN} channels in the medial septum influence memory. Specifically, they suggest that septal {HCN} channels play a permissive role in spatial working memory, but do not influence emotional long-term memory. Given that these channels are preferentially located on {GABA} septo-hippocampal projection neurons, the present data provide further evidence that these projection neurons are involved in memory.},

Lesions were near complete as measured by choline acetyltransferase ({ChAT}) activity and immunohistochemistry. Behavioral testing was performed in three phases.

In the second phase, the optimal locations were retested with increasing intertrial intervals ({ITI}). In the third phase, intracerebroventricular infusions of nerve growth factor ({NGF}) were employed to enhance cholinergic activity of the unlesioned rats and potentially further separate group performance. Neither the standard or increased {ITI} resulted in a consistent significant difference in spatial working memory between groups. In addition, {NGF} treatment also failed to induce a significant difference in behavioral performance. In conclusion, impairments in working memory as assessed by the mwm could not be revealed despite a greater than 90\% loss of hippocampal {ChAT} and the use of optimal testing parameters and {NGF} treatment.},

To address this issue, whole-cell patch recordings and neuronal reconstructions were performed on rat brain slices containing the medial septum/diagonal band complex ({MS}/{DB}). Slow firing neurons were identified by their low firing rate at threshold ({\textless}5 Hz) and lack of time-dependent inward rectification (Ih). Unsupervised cluster analysis was used to investigate whether slow firing neurons could be further classified into different subtypes. The parameters used for the cluster analysis included latency for first spike, slow after-hyperpolarizing potential, maximal frequency and action potential ({AP}) decay slope. Neurons were grouped into three major subtypes. The majority of neurons (55\%) were grouped as cluster I. Cluster {II} (17\% of neurons) exhibited longer latency for generation of the first action potential (246.5+/-20.1 ms). Cluster {III} (28\% of neurons) exhibited higher maximal firing frequency (25.3+/-1.7 Hz) when compared with cluster I (12.3+/-0.9 Hz) and cluster {II} (11.8+/-1.1 Hz) neurons. Additionally, cluster {III} neurons exhibited faster action potentials at suprathreshold. Interestingly, cluster {II} neurons were frequently located in the medial septum whereas neurons in cluster I and {III} appeared scattered throughout all {MS}/{DB} regions. Sholl's analysis revealed a more complex dendritic arborization in cluster {III} neurons. Cluster I and {II} neurons exhibited characteristics of "true" slow firing neurons whereas cluster {III} neurons exhibited higher frequency firing patterns. Several neurons were labeled with a cholinergic marker, Cy3-conjugated 192 {IgG} (p75NTR), and cholinergic neurons were found to be distributed among the three clusters. Our findings indicate that slow firing medial septal neurons are heterogeneous and that soma location is an important determinant of their electrophysiological properties. Thus, slow firing neurons from different septal regions have distinct functional properties, most likely related to their diverse connectivity.},

Two weeks after lesions to cholinergic neurons, significant cell rescue (65+/-8\% neuron survival; P{\textless}0.005 compared to controls) was observed when {NGF} expression was activated. Treatment with the tetracycline analog doxycycline to turn gene expression "off" resulted in a significant loss of cholinergic neurons (only 37+/-5\% neurons remained, an amount that did not differ from untreated, lesioned controls). Animals treated with a constitutively active and robust nonregulated {NGF} expression system showed the same degree of neuronal rescue (73+/-8\%) as animals treated with activated tet-regulated vectors. {ELISA} measurements confirmed that oral treatment of animals with doxycycline reduced {NGF} protein levels to levels in untreated control subjects.

The aim of this study was to correlate the presence of perineuronal nets with electrophysiological properties and parvalbumin immunoreactivity in {MS}/{DB} neurons. Intracellular recordings were made from cells in a brain slice preparation maintained in vitro, and neurons were characterized into four populations: (i) slow-firing neurons, (ii) burst-firing neurons, (iii) fast spiking neurons with narrow action potentials and a small degree of spike frequency adaptation, and (iv) regular spiking neurons with broader action potentials and a high degree of spike frequency adaptation. Following electrophysiological characterization, neurons were filled with biocytin, processed for parvalbumin immunoreactivity and stained for perineuronal nets using Wisteria floribunda lectin. The three substances were viewed with triple fluorescence. Fast spiking, nonadapting neurons, shown previously to contain parvalbumin immunoreactivity, were nearly all ensheathed by perineuronal nets. There was a population of small parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons which did not possess perineuronal nets, and which were not encountered with the intracellular electrodes. The other three neuron types in the {MS}/{DB} did not contain parvalbumin immunoreactivity or perineuronal nets. In keeping with this neurochemical profile for electrophysiologically identified neurons, burst-firing neurons had action potential parameters more similar to those of regular spiking than of fast spiking neurons. We conclude that fast spiking neurons, presumed to be {GABAergic} septohippocampal projection neurons, are surrounded by supportive structures to enable the high level of neuronal discharge required for producing disinhibition of hippocampal pyramidal neurons.},

Electrophysiologically, several classes of neurons have been described in the {MSDB}, but their chemical identity remains to be fully established. By combining electrophysiology with single-cell {RT}-{PCR}, we have identified four classes of neurons in the {MSDB} in vitro. The first class displayed slow-firing and little or no Ih, and expressed choline acetyl-transferase {mRNA} ({ChAT}). The second class was fast-firing, had a substantial Ih and expressed glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 {mRNA} ({GAD}67), sometimes co-localized with {ChAT} {mRNAs}. A third class exhibited fast- and burst-firing, had an important Ih and expressed {GAD}67 {mRNA} also occasionally co-localized with {ChAT} {mRNAs}. The ionic mechanism underlying the bursts involved a low-threshold spike and a prominent Ih current, conductances often associated with pacemaker activity. Interestingly, we identified a fourth class that expressed transcripts solely for one or two of the vesicular glutamate transporters ({VGLUT}1 and {VGLUT}2), but not {ChAT} or {GAD}. Some putative glutamatergic neurons displayed electrophysiological properties similar to {ChAT}-positive slow-firing neurons such as the occurrence of a very small Ih, but nearly half of glutamatergic neurons exhibited cluster firing with intrinsically generated voltage-dependent subthreshold membrane oscillations. Neurons belonging to each of the four described classes were found among septohippocampal neurons by retrograde labelling. We provide results suggesting that slow-firing cholinergic, fast-firing and burst-firing {GABAergic}, and cluster-firing glutamatergic neurons, may each uniquely contribute to hippocampal rhythmicity in vivo.},

There was a sharp (three-fold) increase in the number of cells with rhythmic discharge volleys, along with changes in the parameters of volley activity - both in neurons with the endogenous (pacemaker) pattern and in cells with secondary involvement in rhythmic activity. The possible mechanisms for these changes are discussed.

	abstract = {To determine whether plasma lactate can be a significant fuel for human brain energy metabolism, infusions of [3-(13)C]lactate and (1)H-(13)C polarization transfer spectroscopy were used to detect the entry and utilization of lactate. During the 2 h infusion study, (13)C incorporation in the amino acid pools of glutamate and glutamine were measured with a 5 min time resolution. With a plasma concentration ([Lac](P)) being in the 0.8-2.8 mmol/L range, the tissue lactate concentration ([Lac](B)) was assessed as well as the fractional contribution of lactate to brain energy metabolism ({CMRlac}). From the measured relationship between unidirectional lactate influx (V(in)) and plasma and brain lactate concentrations, lactate transport constants were calculated using a reversible Michaelis-Menten model. The results show that (1) in the physiological range, plasma lactate unidirectional transport (V(in)) and concentration in tissue increase close to linearly with the lactate concentration in plasma; (2) the maximum potential contribution of plasma lactate to brain metabolism is 10\% under basal plasma lactate conditions of ∼1.0 mmol/L and as much as 60\% at supraphysiological plasma lactate concentrations when the transporters are saturated; (3) the half-saturation constant K(T) is 5.1 ± 2.7 mmol/L and V({MAX}) is 0.40 ± 0.13 μmol · g(-1) · min(-1) (68\% confidence interval); and (4) the majority of plasma lactate is metabolized in neurons similar to glucose.},

Rats chronically epileptic for 1 month received [1-(13)C]glucose, a substrate for neurons and astrocytes, and [1,2-(13)C]acetate, a substrate for astrocytes only. Analyses of extracts from cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampal formation (hippocampus, amygdala, entorhinal, and piriform cortices) were performed using (13)C and (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and {HPLC}. In the hippocampal formation of epileptic rats, levels of glutamate, aspartate, N-acetyl aspartate, adenosine triphosphate plus adenosine diphosphate and glutathione were decreased. In all regions studied, labeling from [1,2-(13)C]acetate was similar in control and epileptic rats, indicating normal astrocytic metabolism. However, labeling of glutamate, {GABA}, aspartate, and alanine from [1-(13)C]glucose was decreased in all areas possibly reflecting neuronal loss. The labeling of glutamine from [1-(13)C]glucose was decreased in cerebral cortex and cerebellum and unchanged in hippocampal formation. In conclusion, no changes were detected in glial-neuronal interactions in the hippocampal formation while in cortex and cerebellum the flow of glutamate to astrocytes was decreased, indicating a disturbed glutamate-glutamine cycle. This is, to our knowledge, the first study showing that metabolic disturbances are confined to neurons inside the epileptic circuit.},

Thus, a broad variety of mutation in mitochondrial {DNA} or nuclear genes leading to the impairment of mitochondrial respiratory chain or of mitochondrial {ATP} synthesis has been associated with epileptic phenotypes. Additionally, with a variety of different methods impaired mitochondrial function has been reported for the seizure focus of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and Ammon's horn sclerosis and of animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy. Since mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation provides the major source of {ATP} in neurons and mitochondria participate in cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis, their dysfunction strongly affects neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission, which is proposed to be highly relevant for seizure generation. Additionally, mitochondrial dysfunction is known to trigger neuronal cell death, which is a prominent feature of therapy-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. Therefore, mitochondria have to be considered as promising targets for neuroprotective strategies in epilepsy.},

	abstract = {Emerging evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the pathophysiology of epilepsy. Recurrent mitochondrial Ca2+ ion load during seizures might act on mitochondrial membrane potential ({DeltaPsim}) and proton motive force. By using electrophysiology and confocal laser-scanning microscopy, we investigated the effects of epileptiform activity, as induced by low-Mg2+ ion perfusion in hippocampal slice cultures, on changes in {DeltaPsim} and in mitochondrial Ca2+ ion concentration ([Ca2+]m). The mitochondrial compartment was identified by monitoring {DeltaPsim} in the soma and dendrites of patched {CA}3 pyramidal cells using the mitochondria-specific voltage-sensitive dye rhodamine-123 (Rh-123). Interictal activity was accompanied by localized mitochondrial depolarization that was restricted to a few mitochondria in small dendrites. In contrast, robust Rh-123 release into the cytosol was observed during seizure-like events ({SLEs}), indicating simultaneous depolarization of mitochondria. This was critically dependent on Ca2+ ion uptake and extrusion, because inhibition of the mitochondrial Ca2+ ion uniporter by Ru360 and the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ ion exchanger by 7-chloro-5-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,5-dihydro-4,1-benzothiazepin-2(3H)-one but not the inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition pore, cyclosporin A, decreased the {SLE}-associated mitochondrial depolarization. The Ca2+ ion dependence of simultaneous mitochondrial depolarization suggested enhanced Ca2+ ion cycling across mitochondrial membranes during epileptiform activity. Indeed, [Ca2+]m fluctuated during interictal activity in single dendrites, and these fluctuations spread over the entire mitochondrial compartment during {SLEs}, as revealed using mitochondria-specific dyes (rhod-2 and rhod-ff) and spatial frequency-based image analysis. These findings strengthen the hypothesis that epileptic activity results in Ca2+ ion-dependent changes in mitochondrial function that might contribute to the neuronal injury during epilepsy.},

	abstract = {Learning and memory are critically dependent on basal forebrain cholinergic ({BFC}) neuron excitability, which is modulated profoundly by leak K(+) channels. Many neuromodulators closing leak K(+) channels have been reported, whereas their endogenous opener remained unknown. We here demonstrate that nitric oxide ({NO}) can be the endogenous opener of leak K(+) channels in the presumed {BFC} neurons. Bath application of 1 {mM} S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine ({SNAP}), an {NO} donor, induced a long-lasting hyperpolarization, which was often interrupted by a transient depolarization. Soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitors prevented {SNAP} from inducing hyperpolarization but allowed {SNAP} to cause depolarization, whereas bath application of 0.2 {mM} 8-bromoguanosine-3',5'-cyclomonophosphate (8-Br-{cGMP}) induced a similar long-lasting hyperpolarization alone. These observations indicate that the {SNAP}-induced hyperpolarization and depolarization are mediated by the {cGMP}-dependent and -independent processes, respectively. When examined with the ramp command pulse applied at -70 {mV} under the voltage-clamp condition, 8-Br-{cGMP} application induced the outward current that reversed at K(+) equilibrium potential (E(K)) and displayed Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz rectification, indicating the involvement of voltage-independent K(+) current. By contrast, {SNAP} application in the presumed {BFC} neurons either dialyzed with the {GTP}-free internal solution or in the presence of 10 {muM} Rp-8-bromo-beta-phenyl-1,N(2)-ethenoguanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate sodium salt, a protein kinase G ({PKG}) inhibitor, induced the inward current that reversed at potentials much more negative than E(K) and close to the reversal potential of Na(+)-K(+) pump current. These observations strongly suggest that {NO} activates leak K(+) channels through {cGMP}-{PKG}-dependent pathway to markedly decrease the excitability in {BFC} neurons, while {NO} simultaneously causes depolarization by the inhibition of Na(+)-K(+) pump through {ATP} depletion.},

	abstract = {Intrasynaptic [glutamate] must be kept low in order to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio after the release of transmitter glutamate. This is accomplished by rapid uptake of glutamate into astrocytes, which convert glutamate into glutamine. The latter then is released to neurons, which, via mitochondrial glutaminase, form the glutamate that is used for neurotransmission. This pattern of metabolic compartmentation is the "glutamate-glutamine cycle." This model is subject to the following two important qualifications: 1) brain avidly oxidizes glutamate via aspartate aminotransferase; and 2) because almost no glutamate crosses from blood to brain, it must be synthesized in the central nervous system ({CNS}). The primary source of glutamate carbon is glucose, and a major source of glutamate nitrogen is the branched-chain amino acids, which are transported rapidly into the {CNS}. This arrangement accomplishes the following: 1) maintenance of low external [glutamate], thereby maximizing signal-to-noise ratio upon depolarization; 2) the replenishing of the neuronal glutamate pool; 3) the "trafficking" of glutamate through the extracellular fluid in a nonneuroactive form (glutamine); 4) the importation of amino groups from blood, thus maintaining brain nitrogen homeostasis; and 5) the oxidation of glutamate/glutamine, a process that confers an additional level of control in terms of the regulation of brain glutamate, aspartate and gamma-aminobutyric acid.},

	abstract = {The medial septum ({MS}) is an indispensable component of the subcortical network which synchronizes the hippocampus at theta frequency during specific stages of information processing. {GABAergic} neurons exhibiting highly regular firing coupled to the hippocampal theta rhythm are thought to form the core of the {MS} rhythm-generating network. In recent studies the hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated non-selective cation ({HCN}) channel was shown to participate in theta synchronization of the medial septum. Here, we tested the hypothesis that {HCN} channel expression correlates with theta modulated firing behaviour of {MS} neurons by a combined anatomical and electrophysiological approach. {HCN}-expressing neurons represented a subpopulation of {GABAergic} cells in the {MS} partly overlapping with parvalbumin ({PV})-containing neurons. Rhythmic firing in the theta frequency range was characteristic of all {HCN}-expressing neurons. In contrast, only a minority of {HCN}-negative cells displayed theta related activity. All {HCN} cells had tight phase coupling to hippocampal theta waves. As a group, {PV}-expressing {HCN} neurons had a marked bimodal phase distribution, whereas {PV}-immunonegative {HCN} neurons did not show group-level phase preference despite significant individual phase coupling. Microiontophoretic blockade of {HCN} channels resulted in the reduction of discharge frequency, but theta rhythmic firing was perturbed only in a few cases. Our data imply that {HCN}-expressing {GABAergic} neurons provide rhythmic drive in all phases of the hippocampal theta activity. In most {MS} theta cells rhythm genesis is apparently determined by interactions at the level of the network rather than by the pacemaking property of {HCN} channels alone.},

This {GPI}-anchored protein exerts many functions, including roles in neuron proliferation, neuroprotection or redox homeostasis. There are, however, conflicting data concerning its role in synaptic transmission. Although several studies report that {PrPc} participates in {NMDA}-mediated neurotransmission, parallel studies describe normal behavior of {PrPc}-mutant mice. Abnormal axon connections have been described in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampi of {PrPc}-deficient mice similar to those observed in epilepsy. A study indicates increased susceptibility to kainate ({KA}) in these mutant mice. We extend the observation of these studies by means of several histologic and biochemical analyses of {KA}-treated mice. {PrPc}-deficient mice showed increased sensitivity to {KA}-induced seizures in vivo and in vitro in organotypic slices. In addition, we show that this sensitivity is cell-specific because interference experiments to abolish {PrPc} expression increased susceptibility to {KA} in {PrPc}-expressing cells. We indicate a correlation of susceptibility to {KA} in cells lacking {PrPc} with the differential expression of {GluR}6 and {GluR}7 {KA} receptor subunits using real-time {RT}-{PCR} methods. These results indicate that {PrPc} exerts a neuroprotective role against {KA}-induced neurotoxicity, probably by regulating the expression of {KA} receptor subunits.},

How and when these sex differences originate is unclear. Because estrogen modulates sexual differentiation of several brain regions during development and influences neurogenesis in adult mammals, we hypothesized that sexual dimorphism of the cholinergic septo-hippocampal system would extend to its neurogenesis. A birthdating agent 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine ({BrdU}) was injected into pregnant dams on one of eight gestational days, ranging from embryonic day (E)10 to E17. The offspring were euthanized at 2 months of age, and brains were processed for {BrdU} and choline acetyltransferase ({ChAT}) immunoreactivity to label cholinergic neurons that became postmitotic on a given embryonic day and survived to adulthood. Unbiased stereology was used to compare the number of double-labeled neurons in the medial septum ({MS}) of female and male offspring. Cholinergic neurons in the {MS} were generated primarily between E11 and E14, similar to other published reports. We found sex differences in the pattern of peak neurogenesis but not in the length of neurogenesis, or in total number of neurons generated in the {MS}. Additionally, in adult female and male mice, we estimated the total number of cholinergic neurons using unbiased stereology and found no sex differences in the number of cholinergic neurons or in the volume of the {MS} in adulthood. These results suggest that sex differences noted in the function of the postnatal cholinergic septo-hippocampal system may originate from its neurogenesis.},

Due to their non-selective profile, however, they potently modulate several sup-type specific {GABA}(A) receptors, contributing to their broad-range side effects. Based on observations in genetically altered mice, however, it has been proposed that anxiolytic action of benzodiazepines is predominantly mediated by {GABA}(A) alpha2/3 subunit-containing receptors. In the present study we analyzed the actions of the preferential {GABA}(A) alpha1 and alpha2/3 {PAMs}, zolpidem and L-838417, respectively on hippocampal {EEG} and medial septum neuronal activity in anesthetized rats. In parallel, a computational model was constructed to model pharmacological actions of these compounds on the septo-hippocampal circuitry. The present results demonstrated that zolpidem inhibited theta oscillation both in the hippocampus and septum, and profoundly inhibited firing activity of septal neurons. L-838417 also inhibited hippocampal and septal theta oscillation, however, it did not significantly alter firing rate activity of septal neurons. Our computational model showed that cessation of periodic firing of hippocampo-septal neurons, representing absence of hippocampal theta activity, disrupted oscillation of septal units, without altering their overall firing activity, similar to changes observed in our in vivo experiments following administration of L-838417. Understanding the correlation between changes in septo-hippocampal activity and actions of selective modulators of {GABA}(A) subtype receptor modulators would further advance design of anxiolytic drugs.},

Previous studies suggest that amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) accumulation may trigger degeneration in {AD}. This study evaluates the effects of single injections of Abeta 1-40 into the medial septum. Immunohistochemistry revealed a decrease in septal cholinergic (57\%) and glutamatergic (53\%) neurons in Abeta 1-40 treated tissue. Additionally, glutamatergic terminals were significantly less in Abeta treated tissue. In contrast, septal {GABAergic} neurons were spared. Unitary recordings from septal neurons and hippocampal field potentials revealed an approximately 50\% increase in firing rates of slow firing septal neurons during theta rhythm and large irregular amplitude ({LIA}) hippocampal activities and a significantly reduced hippocampal theta rhythm power (49\%) in Abeta 1-40 treated tissue. Abeta also markedly reduced the proportion of slow firing septal neurons correlated to the hippocampal theta rhythm by 96\%. These results confirm that Abeta alters the anatomy and physiology of the medial septum contributing to septo-hippocampal dysfunction. The Abeta induced injury of septal cholinergic and glutamatergic networks may contribute to an altered hippocampal theta rhythm which may underlie the memory loss typically observed in {AD} patients.},

	abstract = {In the dentate gyrus, granule cells are ischemia-resistant, but at least five types of predominantly spiny hilar neurons are extremely vulnerable to ischemia. Many of the ischemia-sensitive subtypes of hilar neurons appear to be involved in: (i) the regulation of {GABAergic} inhibition in the dentate gyrus, and (ii) the generation of hilar neuronal synchrony. The present study examined functional consequences of ischemia-induced hilar neuronal loss on {GABAergic} inhibition of granule cells and hilar neuronal synchrony. Transient (15 min) forebrain ischemia was induced by a modification of the four-vessel-occlusion method producing a substantial hilar neuronal loss as demonstrated by the Gallyas silver stain method. Three months later, we have examined spontaneous and stimulus-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents mediated by both {GABA}(A) and {GABA}(B) receptors, and inhibitory bursts induced by 4-aminopyridine (50 {microM}) using whole-cell recordings in coronal brain slices maintained at 34-36 degree C in the presence of excitatory amino acid receptor blockers. Spontaneous dentate spikes reflecting hilar neuronal synchrony and synaptic responses evoked by perforant path stimulation were also recorded in vivo to assess synchrony and inhibition in the dentate gyrus. In spite of significant damage to several types of hilar neurons, there were no marked differences in the conductance, kinetics, and 4-aminopyridine-induced burst frequencies of synaptic {GABA}(A) and {GABA}(B) responses in granule cells. Furthermore, both paired-pulse inhibition and dentate spikes appeared to be normal in vivo. We conclude that there appears to be little impairment of {GABAergic} inhibition of granule cells or of hilar neuronal synchrony three months following a massive ischemic damage to spiny hilar neurons.},

Interareal projections are mainly mediated by glutamatergic pyramidal cell projections; only few long-range {GABAergic} connections have been reported. Using in vivo recording and labeling of single cells and retrograde axonal tracing, we demonstrate novel long-range {GABAergic} projection neurons in the rat hippocampus: (1) somatostatin- and predominantly {mGluR}1alpha-positive neurons in stratum oriens project to the subiculum, other cortical areas, and the medial septum; (2) neurons in stratum oriens, including somatostatin-negative ones; and (3) trilaminar cells project to the subiculum and/or other cortical areas but not the septum. These three populations strongly increase their firing during sharp wave-associated ripple oscillations, communicating this network state to the septotemporal system. Finally, a large population of somatostatin-negative {GABAergic} cells in stratum radiatum project to the molecular layers of the subiculum, presubiculum, retrosplenial cortex, and indusium griseum and fire rhythmically at high rates during theta oscillations but do not increase their firing during ripples. The {GABAergic} projection axons have a larger diameter and thicker myelin sheet than those of {CA}1 pyramidal cells. Therefore, rhythmic {IPSCs} are likely to precede the arrival of excitation in cortical areas (e.g., subiculum) that receive both glutamatergic and {GABAergic} projections from the {CA}1 area. Other areas, including the retrosplenial cortex, receive only rhythmic {GABAergic} {CA}1 input. We conclude that direct {GABAergic} projections from the hippocampus to other cortical areas and the septum contribute to coordinating oscillatory timing across structures.},

In accordance, changes in {VGLUT}1 and {VGLUT}2 {mRNA} concentrations were found to occur in these and other brain areas between P14 and P60, as revealed by semiquantitative {RT}-{PCR} and quantitated by ribonuclease protection assay. {VGLUT}1 and -2 coexpression in the hippocampal formation is supported further by in situ hybridization data showing that virtually all cells in the {CA}1-{CA}3 pyramidal and granule cell layers were highly positive for both transcripts until P14. It was revealed using sc-{RT}-{mPCR} that transcripts for {VGLUT}1 and {VGLUT}2 were also present in neurons of the cerebellum, striatum, and septum that expressed markers for gamma-aminobutyric acid ({GABA})ergic or cholinergic phenotypes, as well as in hippocampal cells containing transcripts for the glial fibrillary acidic protein.

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}

Vesicular glutamate transporters ({VGLUTs}) are responsible for loading synaptic vesicles with glutamate, determining the phenotype of glutamatergic neurons, and have been implicated in the regulation of quantal size and presynaptic plasticity. We analyzed {VGLUT} subtype expression in normal human hippocampus and tested the hypothesis that alterations in {VGLUT} expression may contribute to long-term changes in glutamatergic transmission reported in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy ({TLE}).


{METHODS}

{VGLUT} immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, in situ hybridization, Western blotting, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction ({qPCR}) were performed on biopsies from {TLE} patients without (non-{HS}) and with hippocampal sclerosis ({HS}) and compared to autopsy controls and rat hippocampus. {VGLUT}1 expression was compared with synaptophysin, neuropeptide Y ({NPY}), and Timm's staining.


{RESULTS}

{VGLUT}1 was the predominant {VGLUT} in human hippocampus and appeared to be localized to presynaptic glutamatergic terminals. In non-{HS} hippocampi, {VGLUT}1 protein levels were increased compared to control and {HS} hippocampi in all subfields. In {HS} hippocampi {VGLUT}1 expression was decreased in subfields with severe neuronal loss, but strongly up-regulated in the dentate gyrus, characterized by mossy fiber sprouting.


{DISCUSSION}

{VGLUT}1 is used as marker for glutamatergic synapses in the human hippocampus. In {HS} hippocampi {VGLUT}1 up-regulation in the dentate gyrus probably marks new glutamatergic synapses formed by mossy fiber sprouting. Our data indicate that non-{HS} patients have an increased capacity to store glutamate in vesicles, most likely due to an increase in translational processes or upregulation of {VGLUT}1 in synapses from afferent neurons outside the hippocampus. This up-regulation may increase glutamatergic transmission, and thus contribute to increased extracellular glutamate levels and hyperexcitability.},

	abstract = {Normal human consciousness may be impaired by two possible routes: direct reduced function in widespread cortical regions or indirect disruption of subcortical activating systems. The route through which temporal lobe limbic seizures impair consciousness is not known. We recently developed an animal model that, like human limbic seizures, exhibits neocortical deactivation including cortical slow waves and reduced cortical cerebral blood flow ({CBF}). We now find through functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) that electrically stimulated hippocampal seizures in rats cause increased activity in subcortical structures including the septal area and mediodorsal thalamus, along with reduced activity in frontal, cingulate, and retrosplenial cortex. Direct recordings from the hippocampus, septum, and medial thalamus demonstrated fast poly-spike activity associated with increased neuronal firing and {CBF}, whereas frontal cortex showed slow oscillations with decreased neuronal firing and {CBF}. Stimulation of septal area, but not hippocampus or medial thalamus, in the absence of a seizure resulted in cortical deactivation with slow oscillations and behavioral arrest, resembling changes seen during limbic seizures. Transecting the fornix, the major route from hippocampus to subcortical structures, abolished the negative cortical and behavioral effects of seizures. Cortical slow oscillations and behavioral arrest could be reconstituted in fornix-lesioned animals by inducing synchronous activity in the hippocampus and septal area, implying involvement of a downstream region converged on by both structures. These findings suggest that limbic seizures may cause neocortical deactivation indirectly, through impaired subcortical function. If confirmed, subcortical networks may represent a target for therapies aimed at preserving consciousness in human temporal lobe seizures.},

	abstract = {The medial septum inhibits the appearance of interictal spikes and seizures through theta rhythm generation. We have determined that medial septal neurons increase their firing rates during chronic epilepsy and that the {GABAergic} neurons from both medial and lateral septal regions are highly and selectively vulnerable to the epilepsy process. Since the lateral septal region receives a strong projection from the hippocampus and its neurons are vulnerable to epilepsy, their functional properties are probably altered by this disorder. Using the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy we examined the pilocarpine-induced functional alterations of lateral septal neurons and provided additional observations on the pilocarpine-induced functional alterations of medial septal neurons. Simultaneous extracellular recordings of septal neurons and hippocampal field potentials were obtained from chronic epileptic rats under urethane anesthesia. Our results show that: (1) the firing rates of lateral septal neurons were chronically decreased by epilepsy, (2) a subset of lateral septal neurons increased their firing rates before and during hippocampal interictal spikes, (3) the discharges of those lateral septal neurons were well correlated to the hippocampal interictal spikes, (4) in contrast, the discharges of medial septal neurons were not correlated with the hippocampal interictal spikes. We conclude that epilepsy creates dysfunctional and uncoupled septo-hippocampal networks. The elucidation of the roles of altered septo-hippocampal neuronal populations and networks during temporal lobe epilepsy will help design new and effective interventions dedicated to reduce or suppress epileptic activity.},

	abstract = {Epidemiological data indicate that 20-40\% of the patients with epilepsy are refractory to treatment with antiepileptic drugs ({AEDs}). The mechanisms underlying pharmacoresistance in epilepsy are unclear, but several plausible hypotheses have emerged, including loss of {AED} target sensitivity in the epileptic brain, decreased {AED} concentrations at brain targets because of localized overexpression of drug efflux transporters in epileptogenic brain tissue, and network alterations in response to brain damage associated with epilepsy. Rat models of epilepsy in which part of the animals are resistant to treatment with {AEDs} offer a means to investigate the mechanisms underlying {AED} resistance. In the present study, {AED}-responsive and {AED}-resistant rats were selected from a model in which spontaneous recurrent seizures develop after a status epilepticus induced by electrical stimulation of the basolateral amygdala. For selection into responders and nonresponders, epileptic rats were treated over two weeks by phenobarbital. Subsequent histological examination showed neurodegeneration of the {CA}1, {CA}3 and dentate hilus in only one of eight responders but five of six nonresponders (P=0.0256). Based on previous studies in {AED}-resistant rats of this model, we hypothesized that changes in the structure and function of inhibitory {GABA}(A) receptors may contribute to drug resistance. We therefore analyzed the distribution and expression of several {GABA}(A) receptor subunits (alpha1, alpha2, alpha 3, alpha 4, alpha 5, beta2/3, and gamma 2) immunohistochemically with specific antibodies in the hippocampal formation of responders, nonresponders and nonepileptic controls. In nonresponders, decreased subunit staining was observed in {CA}1, {CA}2, {CA}3, and dentate gyrus, whereas much less widespread alterations were determined in responders. Furthermore, upregulation of the alpha 4-subunit was observed in the {CA}1 of nonresponders. Our data suggest that alterations in {GABA}(A) receptor subtypes may be involved in resistance to {AEDs}.},

To study oscillatory activities of the {CA}3 field in theta range, a model of this sub-field of Hippocampus has been formulated. The model describes the firing activity of {CA}3 neuronal populations within the frame of a kinetic theory of neural systems and it has been used for computer simulations. The results show that the propagation of activities induced in the neural field by hippocampal afferents occurs only in narrow time windows confined by inhibitory barrages, whose time-course follows the theta rhythm. Moreover, during each period of a theta wave, the entire {CA}3 field bears a firing activity with peculiar space-time patterns, a sort of specific imprint, which can induce effects with similar patterns on brain regions driven by the hippocampal formation. The simulation has also demonstrated the ability of medial septum to influence the global activity of the {CA}3 pyramidal population through the control of the population of inhibitory interneurons. At last, the possible involvement of global population oscillations in neural coding has been discussed.},

The existence of noncholinergic, non-{GABAergic}, most likely glutamatergic septal neurons has recently been reported. However, their morphological characteristics, numbers, distribution, and connectivity have not been determined. Furthermore, the projection of septal glutamatergic neurons to the hippocampus has not been characterized. To address these issues, subpopulations of cholinergic and {GABAergic} neurons were identified by immunohistochemistry. In addition, the retrograde tracer fluorogold was injected into the hippocampus to determine the characteristics of a glutamatergic septo-hippocampal projection. Our work revealed that although glutamatergic neurons are found throughout the septum, they concentrate in medial septal regions. Using stereological probes, approximately 16,000 glutamatergic neurons were estimated in the medial septal region. Triple immunostaining showed that most glutamatergic neurons do not immunoreact with cholinergic or {GABAergic} neuronal markers (anti-{ChAT} or anti-{GAD}67 antibodies, respectively). Fluorogold injections into {CA}1, {CA}3, and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus showed that septal glutamatergic neurons project to each of these hippocampal regions, forming approximately 23\% of the septo-hippocampal projection. Most cell bodies of septo-hippocampal glutamatergic neurons were located in the medial septum. The remaining cell bodies were found in the diagonal band. This data shows that glutamatergic neurons constitute a significant neuronal population in the septum and that a subpopulation of these neurons projects to hippocampal regions. Thus, the septo-hippocampal projection needs to be reconsidered as a three neurotransmitter pathway.},

	abstract = {'Kindling' is a phenomenon of epileptogenesis, which has been widely used as an experimental model of temporal lobe epilepsy. In the present study, we have examined the contribution of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid ({AMPA}) glutamate receptors and their subunits ({GluR}-A, -B, -C and -D) to the acquisition and maintenance of the kindled state in the pentylenetetrazole ({PTZ})-induced 'kindling' mouse model, by using quantitative autoradiography and in situ hybridization. Region-specific increases in [3H]{AMPA} binding were seen in kindled animals in the {CA}3 region of hippocampus and in the temporal cortex 1 week after the last {PTZ} injection. At the same time, a significant decrease in the level of transcripts encoding the {GluR}-B and -C subunits was detected in the hippocampal {CA}1 region and dentate gyrus, suggestive of a higher proportion of Ca(2+)-permeable {AMPA} receptors in these neurons. These changes did not persist 1 month after establishment of kindling, indicating a transient role of {AMPA} receptors in the acquisition of the kindled state. At 1 month after the last {PTZ} injection, an upregulation in [3H]{AMPA} binding appeared in the motor cortex and the basal ganglia of kindled animals, which is consistent with electrophysiological data showing hyperexcitability in the cortex of the {PTZ}-kindled animals at that time. Interestingly, an increase in {mRNA} for the {GluR}-B subunit appeared in the outer layers of motor and somatosensory cortices of the kindled animals 1 month after acquisition of the kindled state, possibly as part of a gene-regulated, compensatory mechanism against seizure susceptibility, since this change should give rise to a higher proportion of Ca(2+)-impermeable {AMPA} receptors. These results support the evidence of a transient role of hippocampal {AMPA} receptors in the acquisition of the 'kindling' phenomenon and they also suggest an involvement of {AMPA} receptors in the maintenance of kindled state at least in two brain areas, cortex and basal ganglia.},

	abstract = {Synaptic transmission was studied during the development of kindling in the pathway from entorhinal cortex ({EC}) to dentate gyrus ({DG}) of unrestrained unanesthetized rats using chronic neurophysiological techniques. Extracellular field potentials were recorded from the {DG} in response to activation of the perforant pathway with 0.1-ms constant current square-wave pulses. The evoked field potentials consisted of a population {EPSP} (a reflection of excitatory synaptic activation) and a population spike (a measure of synchronous postsynaptic discharge of granule cells). Synaptic efficacy was quantitated in this pathway by measurement of the population {EPSP} slope and population spike amplitude across a range of stimulus intensities from threshold to maximal evoked response. Input-output relationships for population {EPSP} and population spike were determined at regular intervals during the course of kindling, corresponding to the stages of evoked behavioral seizures. Increases in the population {EPSP} and population spike were observed after a single kindling stimulus that evoked afterdischarge ({AD}) when behavioral seizures were minimal. Evaluation of the input-output relationships for the group of kindled animals at the various stages of evoked behavioral seizure activity revealed that increases in the population {EPSP} continued to slowly evolve with repeated stimulations but that increases in the population spike were maximal after one or at most a few stimulations that evoked {AD}. The increases in both population {EPSP} and population spike persisted for the duration of the recording, i.e., through induction of generalized motor convulsions. To evaluate the translation of synaptic activation into cell discharge during kindling, we made use of the population spike/population {EPSP} ratio across a range of stimulus intensities. The spike/{EPSP} ratios revealed a dissociation of the population spike and population {EPSP} early in the course of kindling during class 1 seizures. Specifically, after induction of an {AD}, an extracellular population {EPSP} of a given size evoked a larger population spike than an {EPSP} of comparable size before the induction of an {AD} by kindling stimulation. The development of generalized motor convulsions (class 5 seizures) was associated with a reduction in the spike/{EPSP} ratio. The mechanism of this reduction in spike/{EPSP} ratio is uncertain, but since synaptic activation (as reflected by population {EPSP}) did not decline during class 5 seizures, the reduction in the spike/{EPSP} ratio could be consistent with increased inhibition after generalized motor convulsions, or could reflect a decrease in granule cell excitability.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

In the control, a high correlation between the background activities of the hippocampus and {MSDB} was observed. In the first days of stimulation at the parameters that evoked seizure discharges in the hippocampus, the {MSDB} did not show the epileptiform activity; however, repeated daily stimulation gave rise to epileptiform discharges, which increased with time. As a result of kindling, the {MSDB} became capable of generating seizure activity irrespective of the hippocampus. The degree of correlation between the activities of the two structures sharply decreased during "acute" and "chronic" seizures.

Although the mechanism by which the diet protects against seizures is unknown, there is evidence that it causes effects on intermediary metabolism that influence the dynamics of the major inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitter systems in brain. The pattern of protection of the ketogenic diet in animal models of seizures is distinct from that of other anticonvulsants, suggesting that it has a unique mechanism of action. During consumption of the ketogenic diet, marked alterations in brain energy metabolism occur, with ketone bodies partly replacing glucose as fuel. Whether these metabolic changes contribute to acute seizure protection is unclear; however, the ketone body acetone has anticonvulsant activity and could play a role in the seizure protection afforded by the diet. In addition to acute seizure protection, the ketogenic diet provides protection against the development of spontaneous recurrent seizures in models of chronic epilepsy, and it has neuroprotective properties in diverse models of neurodegenerative disease.},

Zonisamide also modifies dopamine ({DA}) activity, provides protection in ischemia models and influences antioxidant systems. Thus, we tested it for its ability to protect {DA} neurons in a mouse model of {PD} and investigated mechanisms underlying its protection. Concurrent treatment of mice with zonisamide and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetraydropyridine ({MPTP}) attenuated the reduction in striatal contents of {DA}, its metabolite {DOPAC} and tyrosine hydroxylase ({TH}). We also discovered that zonisamide inhibited monoamine oxidase B ({MAO}-B) activity in vitro with an {IC}(50) of 25 {muM}, a concentration that is well within the therapeutic range used for treating epilepsy in humans. Moreover, the irreversible binding of systemically administered selegiline to {MAO}-B in mouse brain was attenuated by zonisamide as measured by ex vivo assays. Zonisamide treatment alone did not produce any lasting effects on ex vivo {MAO}-B activity, indicating that it is a reversible inhibitor of the enzyme. Consistent with the effects of zonisamide on {MAO}-B, the striatal content of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ({MPP}(+)), which is derived from the administered {MPTP} via {MAO}-B actions, was substantially reduced in mice treated with {MPTP} and zonisamide. The potency and reversibility with which zonisamide blocks {MAO}-B may contribute to the ability of the drug to improve clinical symptoms in {PD} patients. The results also suggest that caution in its use may be necessary, especially when administered with other drugs, in the treatment of epilepsy or {PD}.},

Susceptibility to pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus as well as the spontaneous seizure frequency during the chronic period of the model was determined. Since the hippocampus is one of the main structures in the development of this epilepsy model, the 5-{HT} levels in this region were also determined after drug administration. Sixty-three percent of 5,7-{DHT} pre-treated rats (15/24) and only 33.4\% of those receiving the control solution (9/24) progressed to motor limbic seizures evolving to status epilepticus, following the administration of pilocarpine. The frequency of seizures during the chronic period, in epileptic rats that received 5,7-{DHT}, showed a significant (58\%) increase after the treatment, when compared with control group. Our data showed that serotonin may play an important role on seizure activity which seems to be exerted by its inhibitory action on the expression of overt behavior seizures departing from an established focus in the limbic system.},

Mitochondrial and cytosolic enzyme activities were measured spectrophotometrically, and reduced glutathione ({GSH}) concentrations by {HPLC}, and compared to results from sham controls. The earliest change in any sub-region was a fall in {GSH}, appearing as early as 4h in {CA}3 (-13\%, p{\textless}0.05), and persisting at all time points. This was followed by a transient fall in complex I activity ({CA}3, 16h, -13\%, p{\textless}0.05), and later changes in aconitase ({CA}1,-18\% and {CA}3, -22\% at 44h, p{\textless}0.05). The activity of the cytosolic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase was unaffected at all time points. It is known that {GSH} levels are dependent both on redox status, and on the availability of the precursor cysteine, in turn dependent on the cysteine/glutamate antiporter, for which extracellular glutamate concentrations are rate limiting. Both mechanisms are likely to contribute indirectly to {GSH} depletion following seizures. That a relative deficiency in {GSH} precedes later changes in the activities of complex I and aconitase in vulnerable hippocampal sub-regions, occurring within a clinically relevant therapeutic time window, suggests that strategies to boost {GSH} levels and/or otherwise reduce oxidative stress following seizures, deserve further study, both in terms of preventing the biochemical consequences of {SE} and the neuronal dysfunction and clinical consequences.},

	abstract = {In a recent pilot study, joint administration of pyruvate, hydroxycitrate ({HCA}), and carnitine to obese subjects was associated with a remarkable rate of body-fat loss and thermogenesis, strongly suggestive of uncoupled fatty-acid oxidation. Hepatocytes possess an uncoupling mechanism--reverse electron transport--that enables fasting ketogenesis to proceed independent of respiratory control. Electrons entering the respiratory chain at the coenzyme Q ({CoQ}) level via {FAD}-dependent acyl {coA} dehydrogenase, can be driven 'up' the chain by the electrochemical proton gradient to reduce {NAD}+; if these electrons are then shuttled to the cytoplasm, returning to the respiratory chain at the {CoQ} level, the net result is heat generation at the expense of the proton gradient, enabling the uncoupled flow of electrons to oxygen. Pyruvate's bariatric utility may stem from its ability to catalyze the rapid transport of high-energy electrons from mitochondria to the cytoplasm, thus stimulating electron shuttle mechanisms. By enabling rapid mitochondrial uptake of fatty acids and thus disinhibiting hepatocyte ketogenesis, {HCA}/carnitine should initiate reverse electron transport: concurrent amplification of electron shuttle mechanisms by pyruvate can be expected to accelerate this reverse electron transport, thereby decreasing the electrochemical proton gradient. As a result, hepatocytes may be able to convert fatty acids to {CO}2 and heat with little net generation of {ATP}. These considerations suggest that it may be feasible to render hepatocytes functionally equivalent to activated brown fat, such that stored fat can be selectively oxidized in the absence of caloric restriction. Other measures which enhance the efficiency of hepatocyte electron shuttle mechanisms may increase the efficacy of this strategy.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}

Pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying temporal lobe epilepsy ({TLE}) are still poorly understood. One major hypothesis links alterations in energy metabolism to glutamate excitotoxicity associated with seizures in {TLE}. The purpose of this study was to determine whether changes in the activities of enzymes critical in energy and neurotransmitter metabolism contributed to the alterations in metabolic status leading to the excitotoxic effects of glutamate.


{METHODS}

Activities of four key enzymes involved in energy metabolism and glutamate cycling in the brain [aspartate aminotransferase ({AAT}), citrate synthase ({CS}), glutamate dehydrogenase ({GDH}), and lactate dehydrogenase ({LDH})] were measured in anterolateral temporal neocortical and hippocampal tissues obtained from three different groups of medically intractable epilepsy patients having either mesial, paradoxical, or mass lesion-associated temporal lobe epilepsy ({MTLE}, {PTLE}, {MaTLE}), respectively.


{RESULTS}

We found that {GDH} activity was significantly decreased in the temporal cortex mainly in the {MTLE} group. A similar trend was recognized in the hippocampus of the {MTLE}. In all three patient groups, {GDH} activity was considerably lower, and {AAT} and {LDH} activities were higher in cortex of {MTLE} as compared with the corresponding activities in hippocampus (p{\textless}0.05). In the {MTLE} cortex and hippocampus, {GDH} activities were negatively correlated with the duration since the first intractable seizure.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Our results support the hypothesis suggesting major alteration in {GDH} activity mainly in the {MTLE} group. It is proposed that significant alterations in the enzyme activities may be contributing to decreased metabolism of glutamate, leading to its accumulation.},

	abstract = {Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders and approximately one-third of patients with epilepsy are resistant to treatment. In order to develop our understanding of the metabolic changes occurring during seizure a metabolomic approach was employed. Using a pentylenetetrazole ({PTZ}) kindling model of epilepsy metabolomic analysis of brain extracts from the cerebellum, brain stem, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus was performed. Principal component analysis ({PCA}) of the (1)H {NMR} derived data revealed a distinct metabolic profile for each brain region. In order to assess the changes occurring following seizure partial least square discriminant analysis ({PLS}-{DA}) models for each brain region for {PTZ}-kindled and control animals were constructed. For all the brain regions good predictive models were built and the discriminating metabolites were identified. Results following one injection of {PTZ} indicated that the changes observed in the cerebellum and hippocampus were mainly due to seizure. In the hippocampus of {PTZ}-kindled animals the metabolites changing included lactate, succinate, {GABA}, {NAA}, choline and taurine. Analysis of the cerebellum of {PTZ}-kindled animals revealed changes in lactate, myo-inositol, choline, {GABA}, creatine, succinate, phosphocholine and {GPC}. Overall, the results indicate that seizure may be associated with an increase in energy demand, altered neurotransmitter balance and an increase in neuronal loss and gliosis.},

	abstract = {There is now compelling evidence that the excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter glutamate plays a pivotal role in drug addiction and alcoholism. As a result, there has been increasing interest in developing glutamate-based therapies for the treatment of addictive disorders. Receptors for glutamate are primarily divided into two classes: ionotropic glutamate receptors ({iGluRs}) that mediate fast excitatory glutamate transmission, and metabotropic glutamate receptors ({mGluRs}), which are G-protein coupled receptors that mediate slower, modulatory glutamate transmission. Most {iGluR} antagonists, while showing some efficacy in animal models of addiction, exhibit serious side effects when tested in humans. {mGluR} ligands, on the other hand, which have been advanced to testing in clinical trials for various medical conditions, have demonstrated the ability to reduce drug reward, reinforcement, and relapse-like behaviors in animal studies. {mGluR} ligands that have been shown to be primarily effective are Group I ({mGluR}1 and {mGluR}5) negative allosteric modulators and Group {II} ({mGluR}2 and {mGluR}3) orthosteric presynaptic autoreceptor agonists. In this review, we will summarize findings from animal studies suggesting that these {mGluR} ligands may be of potential benefit in reducing on-going drug self-administration and may aid in the prevention of relapse. The neuroanatomical distribution of {mGluR}1, {mGluR}2/3, and {mGluR}5 receptors and the pharmacological properties of Group I negative allosteric modulators and Group {II} agonists will also be overviewed. Finally, we will discuss the current status of {mGluR} ligands in human clinical trials.},

The microdialysis samples were analysed using a {HILIC} (hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography) column, which is able to retain the polar amino acid neurotransmitters. The mobile phase consisted of a binary gradient elution profile comprising 0.1\% formic acid in water and acetonitrile. {GABA}, glutamate as well as the respective internal standards [D(6)]-{GABA} and [D(5)]-glutamate were detected by a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in the positive electrospray ionisation mode within a running time of 3 min. The linearity ranged from 1 {nM} to 10 {microM} for {GABA} and 10 {nM} to 10 {microM} for glutamate. The limit of quantitation was found to be 1 {nM} for {GABA} and 10nM for glutamate (injection volume 10 microl). The present {LC}-{MS}/{MS} method was compared to the classical method for analysis of {GABA} and glutamate using high performance liquid chromatography ({HPLC}) and fluorescence detection ({FD}). Eventually, the feasibility of the {LC}-{MS}/{MS} method was demonstrated using in vivo microdialysis in rats by monitoring changes of the extracellular concentrations of {GABA} and glutamate in the globus pallidus following stimulation with potassium.},

A candidate regulatory protein of Panx1 is the potassium channel subunit Kvbeta3, previously identified by bacterial two-hybrid strategies. Here, we report on the physical association of Panx1 with Kvbeta3 by immunoprecipitation when co-expressed in a neuroblastoma cell line (Neuro2A). Furthermore, in vivo co-expression of Panx1 and Kvbeta3 was shown to occur in murine hippocampus and cerebellum. Kvbeta3 is known to accelerate inactivation of otherwise slowly inactivating potassium channels under reducing conditions. We subsequently found that Panx1 channel currents exhibit a significant reduction when exposed to reducing agents, and that this effect is attenuated in the presence of Kvbeta3. Apparently, Kvbeta3 is involved in regulating the susceptibility of Panx1 channels to redox potential. Furthermore, the Panx1 channel blockers carbenoxolone and Probenecid were less effective in inhibiting Panx1 currents when Kvbeta3 was co-expressed. The influence of Kvbeta3 on Panx1 is the first example of modulation of Panx1 channel function(s) by interacting proteins, and suggests the physiological importance of sensing changes in redox potentials.},

The goal of this study was to determine the extent of mitochondrial oxidative stress, changes to redox status, and mitochondrial {DNA} ({mtDNA}) damage during epileptogenesis in the lithium-pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Mitochondrial oxidative stress, changes in tissue and mitochondrial redox status, and {mtDNA} damage were assessed in the hippocampus and neocortex of Sprague-Dawley rats at time points (24h to 3months) following lithium-pilocarpine administration. A time-dependent increase in mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) production coincident with increased {mtDNA} lesion frequency in the hippocampus was observed during epileptogenesis. Acute increases (24-48h) in H(2)O(2) production and {mtDNA} lesion frequency were dependent on the severity of convulsive seizure activity during initial status epilepticus. Tissue levels of {GSH}, {GSH}/{GSSG}, coenzyme A ({CoASH}), and {CoASH}/{CoASSG} were persistently impaired at all measured time points throughout epileptogenesis, that is, acutely (24-48h), during the 'latent period' (48h to 7days), and chronic epilepsy (21days to 3months). Together with our previous work, these results demonstrate the model independence of mitochondrial oxidative stress, genomic instability, and persistent impairment of mitochondrial specific redox status during epileptogenesis. Lasting impairment of mitochondrial and tissue redox status during the latent period, in addition to the acute and chronic phases of epileptogenesis, suggests that redox-dependent processes may contribute to the progression of epileptogenesis in experimental temporal lobe epilepsy.},

Most efforts to model these deficits in rats have focused on spatial memory dysfunction; this study was the first to assess the effects of {BF} damage in rats on the performance of a battery of object-memory tasks commonly employed to assess brain damage-produced amnesia in primates. The performance of rats with bilateral electrolytic lesions of the medial septum and diagonal band ({MS}/{NDB}) region of the {BF} was assessed on three object-memory tasks: nonrecurring items delayed nonmatching-to-sample ({DNMS}), simple object discrimination, and eight-pair concurrent object discrimination. Lesioned rats and sham-surgery controls were tested on the {DNMS} task at retention delays of 4, 15, 30, 60 and 120 s both before and after surgery. After surgery, the rats with {MS}/{NDB} lesions required significantly more trials than controls to relearn the nonmatching rule; and, once they relearned the rule, they were significantly and comparably impaired at all delays. This impairment did not diminish with either the passage of time or additional practice. In contrast, there were no significant differences between the {MS}/{NDB}-lesioned and control groups in the performance of either simple or concurrent object-discrimination tasks. The delay-independent nature of the {DNMS} deficit and the lack of deficits on the other two object-memory tasks suggest that the effect of the lesion is not the result of an impairment in retention.},

	abstract = {Because brain extracellular acetylcholine ({ACh}) levels are near detection limits in microdialysis samples, an acetylcholinesterase ({AChE}) inhibitor such as neostigmine is often added to microdialysis perfusates to increase {ACh} levels in the dialysate, a practice that raises concerns that the inhibitor might alter the results. Two experiments compared functional differences in {ACh} release with and without neostigmine. In the first experiment, 30-60\% increases in extracellular {ACh} concentrations in the hippocampus were evident during food-rewarded T-maze training with 20-500 nm neostigmine in the perfusate but no increases were seen without neostigmine. In the second experiment, 78\% increases in {ACh} release in the hippocampus were seen after injections of the {GABA}(A) receptor antagonist, bicuculline, into medial septum only if neostigmine (50 nm) was included in the perfusate. These findings suggest that, in the hippocampus, endogenous brain {AChEs} are very efficient at removing extracellular {ACh}, obscuring differences in {ACh} release in these experiments. Therefore, inclusion of {AChE} inhibitors in the microdialysis perfusate may be necessary under some conditions for observations of functional changes in release of {ACh} in the hippocampus.},

	abstract = {Long-term potentiation is a form of neural functional plasticity which has been related with memory formation and recovery of function after brain injury. Previous studies have shown that a transient early-long-term potentiation can be prolonged by direct stimulation of distinct brain areas, or behavioral stimuli with a high motivational content. The basolateral amygdala and other subcortical structures, like the medial septum and the locus coeruleus, are involved in mediating the reinforcing effect. We have previously shown that the lesion of the fimbria-fornix--the main entrance of subcortical afferents to the hippocampus--abolishes the reinforcing basolateral amygdala-effects on long-term potentiation in the dentate gyrus in vivo. It remains to be investigated, however, if such subcortical afferents may also be important for behavioral reinforcement of long-term potentiation. Young-adult (8 weeks) Sprague-Dawley male rats were fimbria-fornix-transected under anesthesia, and electrodes were implanted at the dentate gyrus and the perforant path. One week after surgery the freely moving animals were studied. Fimbria-fornix-lesion reduced the ability of the animals to develop long-term potentiation when a short pulse duration was used for tetanization (0.1 ms per half-wave of a biphasic stimulus), whereas increasing the pulse duration to 0.2 ms per half-wave during tetanization resulted in a transient early-long-term potentiation lasting about 4 h in the lesioned animals, comparable to that obtained in non-lesioned or sham-operated control rats. In water-deprived (24 h) control animals, i.e. in non-lesioned and sham-operated rats, early-long-term potentiation could be behaviorally reinforced by drinking 15 min after tetanization. However, in fimbria-fornix-lesioned animals long-term potentiation-reinforcement by drinking was not detected. This result indicates that the effect of behavioral-motivational stimuli to reinforce long-term potentiation is mediated by subcortical, heterosynaptic afferents.},

Accordingly, several pharmacological ligands have been designed to target these receptors for the treatment of neurological disorders characterized by anomalous glutamate regulation including epilepsy. In this study, we examine whether the expression level and function of {mGlu}2 and {mGlu}3 are altered in experimental epilepsy by using immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, {RT}-{PCR} and extracellular recordings. A down-regulation of {mGlu}2/3 protein expression at the mossy fiber pathway was associated with a significant reduction in {mGlu}2/3 protein expression in the hippocampus and cortex of chronically epileptic rats. Moreover, a reduction in {mGlu}2 and {mGlu}3 transcripts levels was noticed as early as 24 h after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus ({SE}) and persisted during subsequent "latent" and chronic periods. In addition, a significant impairment of {mGlu} {II}-mediated depression of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials at mossy fiber-{CA}3 synapses was detected in chronically epileptic rats. Application of {mGlu} {II} agonists (2S,2'R,3'R)-2-(2',3'-dicarboxycyclopropyl)glycine ({DCG}-{IV}) induced a significant reduction of the {fEPSP} amplitude in control rats, but not in chronic epileptic rats. These data indicate a long-lasting impairment of {mGlu}2/3 expression that may contribute to abnormal presynaptic plasticity, exaggerate glutamate release and hyperexcitability in temporal lobe epilepsy.},

	abstract = {It has been suggested that astrocytic glutamate release or perturbed glutamate metabolism contributes to the proneness to epileptic seizures. Here we investigated whether astrocytic contents of the major glutamate degrading enzymes glutamine synthetase ({GS}) and glutamate dehydrogenase ({GDH}) decreases on moving from the latent phase (prior to seizures) to the chronic phase (after onset of seizures) in the kainate ({KA}) model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Western blotting and immunogold analysis of hippocampal formation indicated similar levels of {GDH} in the latent and chronic phases of {KA} injected rats and in corresponding controls. In contrast, the level of {GS} was increased in the latent phase compared with controls, as assessed by Western blots of whole hippocampal formation and subregions. The increase in {GS} paralleled that of glial fibrillary acidic protein ({GFAP}). Compared with the latent phase, the chronic phase revealed a lower level of {GS} (approaching control levels) but an unchanged {GFAP} content. The decrease in {GS} from latent to chronic phase was significant in whole hippocampal formation, dentate gyrus and {CA}3. It is concluded that kainate treated rats show an initial increase in {GS}, pari passu with the increase in {GFAP}, and a secondary decrease in {GS} that is not accompanied by a similar loss of {GFAP}. In a situation where glutamate catabolism is in high demand the secondary reduction in {GS} level may be sufficient to contribute to the seizure proneness that develops between the latent and chronic phases.},

	abstract = {Group {II} metabotropic ({mGlu} {II}) receptor subtypes {mGlu}2 and {mGlu}3 are important modulators of synaptic plasticity and glutamate release in the brain. Accordingly, several pharmacological ligands have been designed to target these receptors for the treatment of neurological disorders characterized by anomalous glutamate regulation including epilepsy. In this study, we examine whether the expression level and function of {mGlu}2 and {mGlu}3 are altered in experimental epilepsy by using immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, {RT}-{PCR} and extracellular recordings. A down-regulation of {mGlu}2/3 protein expression at the mossy fiber pathway was associated with a significant reduction in {mGlu}2/3 protein expression in the hippocampus and cortex of chronically epileptic rats. Moreover, a reduction in {mGlu}2 and {mGlu}3 transcripts levels was noticed as early as 24 h after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus ({SE}) and persisted during subsequent "latent" and chronic periods. In addition, a significant impairment of {mGlu} {II}-mediated depression of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials at mossy fiber-{CA}3 synapses was detected in chronically epileptic rats. Application of {mGlu} {II} agonists (2S,2'R,3'R)-2-(2',3'-dicarboxycyclopropyl)glycine ({DCG}-{IV}) induced a significant reduction of the {fEPSP} amplitude in control rats, but not in chronic epileptic rats. These data indicate a long-lasting impairment of {mGlu}2/3 expression that may contribute to abnormal presynaptic plasticity, exaggerate glutamate release and hyperexcitability in temporal lobe epilepsy.},

	abstract = {{RATIONALE}

Ketamine or {MK}-801 induced sensorimotor gating deficit, but the underlying neural mechanisms are not completely known. We have previously demonstrated that the medial septum ({MS}) mediated the phencyclidine-induced deficit in prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle ({PPI}) in rats.


{OBJECTIVES}

We investigated the involvement of the supramammillary area ({SUM}) to {MS} pathway in {PPI} impairment and behavioral hyperlocomotion induced by {MK}-801 or ketamine in rats and correlated the behavioral deficits with hippocampal gamma wave increase.


{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}

Ketamine (6 mg/kg, s.c.) or {MK}-801 (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered after infusion of saline or the {GABA}(A) receptor agonist, muscimol (0.25 microg), into the {MS} or {SUM}. Locomotion, {PPI}, and hippocampal electroencephalogram ({EEG}) were recorded.


{RESULTS}

{MK}-801 or ketamine induced {PPI} impairment and behavioral hyperlocomotion, accompanied by an increase in hippocampal gamma waves (30-100 Hz). The changes in behavior and gamma waves induced by ketamine or {MK}-801 were antagonized by pre-infusion of muscimol, but not saline, into the {SUM} or {MS}. Infusion of muscimol into the {SUM} alone did not significantly affect {PPI}, but it suppressed spontaneous locomotor behavior and hippocampal {EEG}. Infusion of ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists into the {MS} did not affect the {PPI} deficit or the gamma wave increase after {MK}-801.


{CONCLUSIONS}

A non-glutamatergic component of the supramammillo-septal pathway mediates the hyperlocomotion and the deficits in {PPI} induced by {MK}-801 or ketamine. Inactivation of the {MS} or {SUM} normalized both the hippocampal gamma waves and the behavioral deficits ({PPI} impairment and hyperlocomotion).},

Intensive clinical and basic research on {MTLE}, perhaps the most common form of human epilepsy, is currently being carried out in epilepsy research centers, and a number of experimental animals models have been developed to help elucidate the pathophysiology of this condition. Animal models are also important for determining how specific lesions induce epileptogenicity, and whether the neuronal mechanisms in mesial temporal lobe limbic structures are the same as those in neocortex. Cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsy remains a major clinical challenge, and much more information needs to be derived from research on patients before relevant experimental animal models can be created.},

	shorttitle = {In vivo and in vitro effects of pilocarpine},
	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}

A common experimental model of status epilepticus ({SE}) utilizes intraperitoneal administration of the cholinergic agonist pilocarpine preceded by methyl-scopolamine treatment. Currently, activation of cholinergic neurons is recognized as the only factor triggering pilocarpine {SE}. However, cholinergic receptors are also widely distributed systemically and pretreatment with methyl-scopolamine may not be sufficient to counteract the effects of systemically injected pilocarpine. The extent of such peripheral events and the contribution to {SE} are unknown and the possibility that pilocarpine also induces {SE} by peripheral actions is yet untested.


{METHODS}

We measured in vivo at onset of {SE}: brain and blood pilocarpine levels, blood-brain barrier ({BBB}) permeability, T-lymphocyte activation and serum levels of {IL}-1beta and {TNF}-alpha. The effects of pilocarpine on neuronal excitability was assessed in vitro on hippocampal slices or whole guinea pig brain preparations in presence of physiologic or elevated [K+](out).


{RESULTS}

Pilocarpine blood and brain levels at {SE} were 1400 +/- 200 {microM} and 200 +/- 80 {microM}, respectively. In vivo, after pilocarpine injection, increased serum {IL}-1beta, decreased {CD}4:{CD}8 T-lymphocyte ratios and focal {BBB} leakage were observed. In vitro, pilocarpine failed to exert significant synchronized epileptiform activity when applied at concentrations identical or higher to levels measured in vivo. Intense electrographic seizure-like events occurred only in the copresence of levels of K+ (6 {mM}) mimicking {BBB} leakage.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Early systemic events increasing {BBB} permeability may promote entry of cofactors (e. g. K+) into the brain leading to pilocarpine-induced {SE}. Disturbance of brain homeostasis represents an etiological factor contributing to pilocarpine seizures.},

We have previously reported an impairment in {GABA}-induced chloride uptake in tg brain [Tehrani and Barnes, Epilepsy Res. 1995;22:13-21]. In order to determine if this alteration in {GABAA} receptor function can be related to specific receptor isoforms, we examined the radioligand binding properties of {GABAA} receptors and the expression of {GABAA} receptor subunit {mRNAs} in the cerebral cortex. Saturation binding of [3H]flunitrazepam revealed a significantly lower Kd value in tg cortical tissues (1.77 +/- 0.05 {nM}) in comparison to that for the background C57BL/6J strain (3.23 +/- 0.23 {nM}), while the Bmax values were indistinguishable. Biphasic displacement of [3H]flunitrazepam binding by 2-oxoquazepam showed that low affinity binding sites account for 36 +/- 7.6 and 51 +/- 7.5\% of the total in control and tg, respectively. The level of [35S]-t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate ({TBPS}) binding to tg cortical membranes was 73.6 +/- 5.8\% of that in controls. Paired measurements by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ({RT}-{PCR}) revealed no significant differences in the levels of {GABAA} receptor alpha 1, alpha 3, alpha 5, beta 2, beta 3, gamma 2 or gamma 3 subunit {mRNAs} between tg and control cortex. However, tg tissues showed elevated levels of alpha 2- and beta 1-subunit {mRNAs}, representing 256 and 177\%, respectively, those of controls. For the tg cortex, the enhanced expression of {GABAA} receptor alpha 2 and beta 1 subunits correlates with recombinant subtypes known to have low affinity for 2-oxoquazepam and impaired binding of {TBPS}. These aberrant properties of {GABAA} receptors could influence the development or propagation of phenotypic seizures in the tottering mouse.},

Perfusion of either non-N-methyl-d-aspartate ({NMDA}) agonist quisqualic acid ({QA}, 50 {microM}) or kainic acid ({KA}, 50 {microM}) through the microdialysis probe significantly enhanced the {ACh} release in the {SFO} area. Local perfusion of the non-{NMDA} receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione ({CNQX}, 10 and 50 {microM}) did not change the basal release of {ACh}. {CNQX} (10 {microM}) administered together with either {QA} (50 {microM}) or {KA} (50 {microM}) in the {SFO} area antagonized the stimulant effect of the agonists on the {ACh} release. In urethane-anesthetized rats, repetitive electrical stimulation (500 {microA}, 10 Hz) of the medial septum ({MS}) significantly increased dialysate {ACh} concentrations in the region of the {SFO}. The increase in the {ACh} release elicited by the {MS} stimulation was significantly potentiated by perfusion of {QA} (50 {microM}), and the {QA}-induced potentiation was prevented by {CNQX} (10 {microM}) treated together with {QA}. These results show that the glutamatergic synaptic inputs enhance the {ACh} release in the {SFO} area through non-{NMDA} receptors.

The {CC} signal showed a similar distribution to cytochrome c oxidase histochemical staining. Strongly stained somata, dendrites and axon terminal clouds were dispersed over the low intensity neuropil staining. The staining was granular and electron microscopic investigation confirmed that the signal was localized in mitochondria. Intensively labeled neurons, showing the morphological features of inhibitory cells, were most frequently found in the principal cell layers, stratum oriens of the {CA}1-3 areas, stratum lucidum and hilus. These neurons contained not only a higher number of mitochondria than the principal cells but the intensity of the mitochondrial staining was evidently stronger. Among the examined interneuronal populations, parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons were intensively labeled for {CC}. Calbindin D28k- ({CB}), somatostatin- and cholecystokinin-labeled cells showed heterogeneous {CC} levels, whereas calretinin-immunoreactive cells never showed a strong {CC} signal. {CB} cells in stratum oriens and alveus layers, lucidum and the hilus were strongly labeled for {CC}. {CB} cells in such regions are known to project to the medial septum and contain somatostatin. We have demonstrated that the {CA}1 interneurons that project to the medial septum (hippocampo-septal neurons) express a high level of {CC}. Thus, similar to the parvalbumin-containing basket and axo-axonic cells, the hippocampo-septal neurons potentially have a high average activity level.},

The medial septum-diagonal band of Broca ({MS}/{DBv}) is a key structure as pacemaker of the oscillation. In addition, some brainstem reticular structures are crucial for the activation of {MS}/{DBv}. Specifically, the nucleus reticularis pontis oralis ({RPO}) is considered the most effective pontine site for eliciting theta rhythm. Nevertheless, its connection with the {MS}/{DBv} is not direct. A previous study by our group pointed out that the nucleus incertus ({NI}) could be considered as a relay in this multisynaptic pathway. From this study, the stimulation of {RPO} increased the discharge rate of {NI} neurons in anesthetized rats and the lesion of the {NI} suppressed the {RPO}-elicited hippocampal theta. Those findings suggested a projection from {RPO} to {NI}, although the existing literature did not support this hypothesis. In order to clarify the dichotomy between the anatomical and the electrophysiological data, we performed a set of tracing studies. Anterograde tracer injections into {RPO} showed a profuse projection to {NI}. This connection was confirmed by retrograde tracer injections into {NI}. Injections of retrograde tracer in {MS}/{DBv} confirmed the intense {NI}-{MS}/{DBv} projection. Furthermore, simultaneous injections of anterograde and retrograde tracers into {RPO} and {MS}/{DBv} respectively resulted in a high-correlated pattern of terminal-like fibers over labeled somata in the {NI}. This study provides the first anatomical evidence of a ponto-septal pathway via the {NI} that contributes to generation and modulation the hippocampal theta activity.},

In freely behaving rats, muscimol (0.25 microg) or saline was infused intracerebrally into one of four areas-the supramammillary area ({SUM}), nucleus accumbens ({NAC}), ventral pallidum ({VP}), and ventral tegmental area ({VTA})-and righting, pain, and {EEG} responses were recorded following either halothane or sodium pentobarbital, representing inhalational and injectable general anesthetic, respectively. The effect of halothane (2\%) or pentobarbital (20 mg/kg i.p.) in abolishing the righting, pain response, or low-voltage neocortical activity was enhanced, and the initial behavioral hyperactivity (delirium) was reduced, after muscimol as compared to after saline infusion in {SUM}, {NAC}, {VP}, and {VTA}. {EEGs} in the hippocampus and the sensorimotor cortex following halothane or pentobarbital showed increased delta, and decreased hippocampal theta and gamma waves after muscimol infusion as compared to saline infusion in {SUM}, {NAC}, {VP}, and {VTA}. By contrast, infusion of muscimol in the median raphe increased locomotion and did not significantly alter the behavioral or {EEG} effects of halothane or pentobarbital. It is suggested that structures that activate the limbic cortices ({MS}, {SUM}, and {VTA} but not the median raphe) or mediate the output of the hippocampus ({NAC} and {VP}) normally participate in maintaining consciousness and inactivation of these structures potentiates the response to a general anesthetic.},

	abstract = {The medial septum and diagonal band complex ({MS}-{DB}) is believed to play a key role in generating theta oscillations in the hippocampus, a phenomenon critical for learning and memory. Although the importance of the {MS}-{DB} in hippocampal theta rhythm generation is generally accepted, it remains to be determined whether the {MS}-{DB} alone can generate hippocampal oscillations or is only a transducer of rhythmic activity from other brain areas. Secondly, it is known that hippocampal theta rhythm can be separated into an atropine-sensitive and insensitive component. However, it remains to be established if the {MS}-{DB} can generate both types of rhythm. To answer these questions, we used a new in vitro rat septohippocampal preparation placed in a hermetically separated two side recording chamber. We showed that carbachol activation of the {MS}-{DB} generated large theta oscillations in the {CA}1 and {CA}3 regions of the hippocampus. These oscillations were blocked by applying either the {GABA}(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline or the {AMPA}/kainate antagonist {DNQX} to the hippocampus. Interestingly, the application of the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine produced only a partial decrease in the amplitude, without modification of the frequency, of theta. These results show for the first time, that upon optimal excitation, the {MS}-{DB} alone is able to generate hippocampal oscillations in the theta frequency band. Moreover, these {MS}-{DB} generated theta oscillations are mediated by muscarinic and nonmuscarinic receptors and have a pharmacological profile similar to theta rhythm observed in awake animals.},

	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15739795},
	abstract = {Our previous studies on conscious rabbits showed that administration of the alpha-2-adrenoreceptor agonist clonidine induces dose-dependent changes in theta oscillations in the septohippocampal system. Low doses of clonidine suppressed theta activity, while high doses produced significant potentiation. It was suggested that the different effects of clonidine might be associated with differences in the sensitivities of pre- and postsynaptic alpha-2-adrenoreceptors to clonidine, this agent being a pure agonist of noradrenaline when used at high doses. It was suggested that functional synergism occurs between the activatory reticular formation and the noradrenergic system of the locus ceruleus in controlling the theta rhythm. The present study was performed to identify the nature of the responses of sensory neurons in the medial septal region in conditions of alterations in the magnitude of the theta rhythm induced by different doses of clonidine. Low and high doses of the agonist given bilaterally into the lateral ventricles were found to have different effects on the sensory responses of neurons in the medial septal region. Injection of small clonidine doses (0.5 microg in 5 microl into each lateral ventricle), which decrease theta activity, was found to lead to weakening of activatory processes and enhancement of inhibitory processes in the medial septal region. The number of activatory responses decreased significantly and persisting responses were significantly weakened; inhibitory responses, conversely, were seen more frequently and were significantly more marked. Administration of high clonidine doses (5 microg in 5 microl), which produce sharp increases in theta oscillations, led to significant reductions in the reactivity of cells in the medial septal region to sensory stimuli (from 76.8\% in controls to 45\% after clonidine), regardless of the nature of the initial responses. Persisting activatory and inhibitory responses were in most cases less marked than the initial responses. These results suggest that alpha-2-adrenoreceptors are involved in controlling the sensory reactivity of neurons in the medial septal region. The impairment of the normal processing of sensory stimuli seen during the continuous generation of rhythmic activity provoked by injection of large clonidine doses supports the role of the theta rhythm in the septohippocampal system as an active filter during the processing and recording of information.},

The facilitation was also seen in Cs(+)-filled cells under voltage-clamp conditions. Both suppressing and facilitating effects were blocked by atropine. 3. All components of the {EPSP} were reduced in the initial phase of {ACh} action, while only the slow component was enhanced during the later phase. The facilitation was blocked by an N-methyl-D-aspartate ({NMDA}) receptor antagonist, d-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (2-{APV}) and by hyperpolarization. 4. {ACh} also facilitated responses to ionophoretically applied {NMDA} in voltage-clamped, Cs(+)-filled cells in Ba2(+)-treated slices. {ACh} facilitated responses to L-glutamate which was blocked by 2-{APV}. {ACh} failed to affect responses to kainate or quisqualate. 5.

Theta frequency and power were measured during independent stimulation of each nuclei and during combined stimulation using three pairings: (1) {MS}-{PH} (2) {MS}-{RPO} and (3) {PH}-{RPO}. Each pairing consisted of parameters known to elicit theta of a high frequency for one nucleus, and parameters known to elicit a low frequency for the second nucleus. This methodology allowed us to observe whether one nucleus preferentially modulated theta activity in the hippocampus in terms of frequency and power. The {MS} was observed to reset theta frequency in both the upward and downward direction when stimulated in combination with either the {PH} (Experiment 1) or the {RPO} (Experiment 2). In Experiment 3 ({PH}-{RPO}), the structure receiving the higher intensity stimulation had the predominate effect on theta frequency. With {MS} stimulation combinations, the power of the elicited theta activity was found to increase over the independent stimulation in some cases during Experiment 1. Likewise, in Experiment 2, the combined stimulation produced a power that in most cases was significantly greater than that measured during the independent stimulations. This effect was not observed with {PH} and {RPO} stimulation combinations. The combined stimulation of the {PH} and {RPO} yielded a power similar to the independent {PH} stimulations. The findings support the following conclusions: (1) the major theta generating activity of the ascending brainstem synchronizing pathways involves projections from the {RPO} to the {PH}, relayed through the {MS}, to the hippocampal formation; and (2) that the {MS} directly controls theta amplitude and secondarily translates the level of ascending brainstem activity into the appropriate frequency of hippocampal theta.},

In addition to cholinergic and {GABAergic} neurons, glutamatergic neurons and neurons that can corelease acetylcholine and glutamate have recently been described in the basal forebrain. Although it is well known that nerve growth factor ({NGF}) promotes synaptic function of cholinergic basal forebrain neurons, how {NGF} affects the newly identified basal forebrain neurons remains undetermined. Here, we examined the effects of {NGF} on synaptic transmission of medial septum and diagonal band of Broca ({MS}-{DBB}) neurons expressing different neurotransmitter phenotypes. We used {MS}-{DBB} neurons from 10- to 13-d-old rats, cultured on astrocytic microislands to promote the development of autaptic connections. Evoked and spontaneous postsynaptic currents were recorded, and neurotransmitters released were characterized pharmacologically. We found that chronic exposure to {NGF} significantly increased acetylcholine and glutamate release from cholinergic {MS}-{DBB} neurons, whereas glutamate and {GABA} transmission from noncholinergic {MS}-{DBB} neurons were not affected by {NGF}. Interestingly, the {NGF}-induced increase in neurotransmission was mediated by p75({NTR}). These results demonstrate a previously unidentified role of {NGF} and its receptor p75({NTR}); their interactions are crucial for cholinergic and glutamatergic transmission in the septohippocampal pathway.},

In this model, expression of the {NR}1 subunit is reduced but not eliminated and the mice are therefore designated as {NR}1 hypomorphic. Previous work suggested that the reduced {NR}1 subunit expression produced a functional subsensitivity as judged by a blunted Fos induction response to a sub-seizure dose of {TZG}. In the present study seizure threshold doses of {TZG} were tested in the wild type and mutant mice. Surprisingly, there was no difference in the seizure sensitivity between the wild type mice and mice presumed to express very low levels of the {NR}1 subunit. An extensive neuroanatomical analysis of Fos induction was conducted after the threshold seizure doses of {TZG}. The results demonstrate that some brain regions of the {NR}1 -/- mice exhibit much lower Fos induction in comparison to the {NR}1 +/+ mice. These regions include hippocampus, amygdala, and cerebral cortical regions. However, in other regions, similar induction of Fos was observed in both genotypes in response to the {NMDA} agonist. Regions showing similar Fos induction in the {NR}1 +/+ and {NR}1 -/- mice include the lateral septum, nucleus of the solitary tract, and medial hypothalamic regions. The results suggest that the {NMDA} receptor hypofunction in the {NR}1 -/- mice is not global but regionally specific and that subcortical structures are responsible for the seizure-inducing effects of {TZG}.},

	abstract = {In the present study, the role of medial septal receptors in behaviour-induced increase in acetylcholine ({ACh}) release in hippocampus was investigated using dual-probe microdialysis in combination with a simple behavioural procedure. gamma-Aminobutyric acid ({GABA}) and glutamate receptor agonists and antagonists were administered by retrograde dialysis into the medial septal area, while {ACh} was measured in the ventral hippocampus. Rats were behaviourally activated by immobilization or handling, but only handling was performed during drug-treatment. The {GABAA} receptor agonist muscimol did not affect {ACh} release, but blocked the handling-induced increase in {ACh} release completely. In addition, muscimol administration induced behavioural activity. Administration of the {GABAA} receptor antagonist bicuculline increased {ACh} release more than 2-fold. However, handling-induced increase in {ACh} release, expressed as percentage of drug-induced release, was similar to that of controls. Administration of the glutamate receptor agonists N-methyl-D-aspartate ({NMDA}) and (S)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid ({AMPA}) in the septal area increased hippocampal {ACh} levels, but reduced the handling-induced increase in {ACh} release. The {NMDA} antagonist, 3-((R)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl) ({CPP}) increased {ACh} levels moderately, and reduced handling-induced increase in {ACh} release. However, similarly to muscimol, {CPP} administration induced behavioural activity. The {AMPA}/kainate receptor antagonist 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione ({DNQX}) did not affect behaviour or basal {ACh} levels, but attenuated the handling-evoked {ACh} release. We conclude that the handling-induced increase in hippocampal {ACh} levels is mediated via stimulation of septal non-{NMDA}, and possibly {NMDA} receptors, whereas {GABAA} receptors are probably not involved.

Despite nearly a century of use, the mechanisms underlying its clinical efficacy remain unknown. In this review, we present one intersecting view of how the {KD} may exert its anticonvulsant activity against the backdrop of several seemingly disparate mechanistic theories. We summarize key insights gleaned from experimental and clinical studies of the {KD}, and focus particular attention on the role that ketone bodies, fatty acids, and limited glucose may play in seizure control. Chronic ketosis is anticipated to modify the tricarboxcylic acid cycle to increase {GABA} synthesis in brain, limit reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) generation, and boost energy production in brain tissue. Among several direct neuro-inhibitory actions, polyunsaturated fatty acids increased after {KD} induce the expression of neuronal uncoupling proteins ({UCPs}), a collective up-regulation of numerous energy metabolism genes, and mitochondrial biogenesis. These effects further limit {ROS} generation and increase energy production. As a result of limited glucose and enhanced oxidative phosphorylation, reduced glycolytic flux is hypothesized to activate metabolic K({ATP}) channels and hyperpolarize neurons and/or glia. Although it is unlikely that a single mechanism, however well substantiated, will explain all of the diet's clinical benefits, these diverse, coordinated changes seem poised to stabilize synaptic function and increase the resistance to seizures throughout the brain.},

Despite numerous therapeutic strategies that reduce hypoxia-ischemia-induced damage in different experimental animal models, most of them have failed to translate to clinical therapies. This challenge calls for an urgent need to explore novel approaches to develop effective therapies for the clinical management of perinatal hypoxia-ischemia brain injury. This review focuses on studies that investigate neuroprotective related events during mammalian hibernation, characterized by dramatic reductions in several parameters including body temperature, oxygen consumption and heart rate, such that it is difficult to tell if the hibernating animal is dead or alive. The first part of this article reviews the mechanisms of metabolic suppression related events during hibernation. In the second part, hypoxic-ischemic events in the perinatal brain are discussed, and in turn, contrasted with brains experiencing metabolic suppression during mammalian hibernation. In the last part of this article, the diverse neuroprotective adaptations of hibernators and the mechanisms that might be involved in mammalian hibernation, and how they could in turn, contribute to neurprotection during perinatal hypoxia-ischemia related injuries are discussed. This article appraises the novel idea that knowledge of the central mechanisms involved in the regulatory metabolic suppression, during which; hibernators switch themselves off without dissolving their brains could represent brain neuroprotective strategy for the clinical management of perinatal hypoxia-ischemia brain injuries in newborns.},

The effects of {NADH} and glutathione in this assay system are likely to be the result of H(2)O(2) generation via a superoxide intermediate because both catalase and superoxide dismutase prevent the oxidation of Amplex Red. These results suggest caution in the assay of H(2)O(2) production in biological systems using the Amplex Red/{HRP} because the assay will also report the mobilization of {NADH} or glutathione. However, the interruption of this process by the addition of superoxide dismutase offers a simple and reliable method for establishing the source of the oxidant signal.},

In this document we review phenomenological models of short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity, in particular spike-timing dependent plasticity ({STDP}). The aim of the document is to provide a framework for classifying and evaluating different models of plasticity. We focus on phenomenological synaptic models that are compatible with integrate-and-fire type neuron models where each neuron is described by a small number of variables. This implies that synaptic update rules for short-term or long-term plasticity can only depend on spike timing and, potentially, on membrane potential, as well as on the value of the synaptic weight, or on low-pass filtered (temporally averaged) versions of the above variables. We examine the ability of the models to account for experimental data and to fulfill expectations derived from theoretical considerations. We further discuss their relations to teacher-based rules (supervised learning) and reward-based rules (reinforcement learning). All models discussed in this paper are suitable for large-scale network simulations.},

	abstract = {Aberrant glutamate and calcium signalings are neurotoxic to specific neuronal populations. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase {II} ({CaMKII}), a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase in neurons, is believed to regulate neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity in response to calcium signaling produced by neuronal activity. Importantly, several {CaMKII} substrates control neuronal structure, excitability, and plasticity. Here, we demonstrate that {CaMKII} inhibition for {\textgreater}4 h using small molecule and peptide inhibitors induces apoptosis in cultured cortical neurons. The neuronal death produced by prolonged {CaMKII} inhibition is associated with an increase in {TUNEL} staining and caspase-3 cleavage and is blocked with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide. Thus, this neurotoxicity is consistent with apoptotic mechanisms, a conclusion that is further supported by dysregulated calcium signaling with {CaMKII} inhibition. {CaMKII} inhibitory peptides also enhance the number of action potentials generated by a ramp depolarization, suggesting increased neuronal excitability with a loss of {CaMKII} activity. Extracellular glutamate concentrations are augmented with prolonged inhibition of {CaMKII}. Enzymatic buffering of extracellular glutamate and antagonism of the {NMDA} subtype of glutamate receptors prevent the calcium dysregulation and neurotoxicity associated with prolonged {CaMKII} inhibition. However, in the absence of {CaMKII} inhibition, elevated glutamate levels do not induce neurotoxicity, suggesting that a combination of {CaMKII} inhibition and elevated extracellular glutamate levels results in neuronal death. In sum, the loss of {CaMKII} observed with multiple pathological states in the central nervous system, including epilepsy, brain trauma, and ischemia, likely exacerbates programmed cell death by sensitizing vulnerable neuronal populations to excitotoxic glutamate signaling and inducing an excitotoxic insult itself.},

	abstract = {Calcium is the major intracellular messenger linking synaptic activity in neurons to gene expression to control diverse functions including adaptive responses to synaptic activity as well as survival and death (Bading et al. 1993; Hardingham et al. 1997; Chawla and Bading 2001; West et al. 2001; Zhang et al. 2007; Flavell and Greenberg 2008; Mellstrom et al. 2008; Redmond 2008; Wayman et al. 2008; Bootman et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2009; Hardingham and Bading 2010). Calcium entry at the synapse acts locally to activate signaling cascades which regulate posttranslational modifications essential for synaptic plasticity, such as the insertion of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors ({AMPARs}) into the postsynaptic membrane (Soderling 2000; Malinow and Malenka 2002; Ehrlich and Malinow 2004). Synaptic activity can also evoke calcium signals in the nucleus which regulate gene pools largely through the phosphorylation of {cAMP} response element-binding protein ({CREB}) and its coactivator, {CREB}-binding protein ({CBP}) (Bading et al. 1993; Hardingham et al. 1997; Hardingham et al. 1999; Hu et al. 1999; Hardingham et al. 2001b; Impey et al. 2002; Zhang et al. 2009). Distinct mechanisms have been proposed to mediate synaptically generated calcium signals in subcompartments of pyramidal neurons; N -methyl- d -aspartate receptors ({NMDARs}) and ryanodine receptors have been implicated in the spine, inositol 3,4,5 triphosphate ({IP}3) receptors in the dendrites, and L-type voltage-gated calcium channels ({VGCCs}) at the soma and nucleus, although both {NMDARs} and {IP}3 receptors can also contribute to somatic and nuclear calcium signals under certain stimulation conditions (Nakamura et al. 1999; Bardo et al. 2006; Raymond and Redman 2006; Watanabe et al. 2006; Hong and Ross 2007; Hagenston et al. 2008; Bengtson et al. 2010).

However, a significant number of patients, especially in the setting of medically-intractable epilepsies, may experience different degrees of memory or cognitive impairment, behavioral abnormalities or psychiatric symptoms, which may limit their daily functioning. As a result, in many patients, epilepsy may resemble a neurodegenerative disease. Epileptic seizures and their potential impact on brain development, the progressive nature of epileptogenesis that may functionally alter brain regions involved in cognitive processing, neurodegenerative processes that relate to the underlying etiology, comorbid conditions or epigenetic factors, such as stress, medications, social factors, may all contribute to the progressive nature of epilepsy. Clinical and experimental studies have addressed the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis and neurodegeneration. We will primarily focus on the findings derived from studies on one of the most common causes of focal onset epilepsy, the temporal lobe epilepsy, which indicate that both processes are progressive and utilize common or interacting pathways. In this chapter we will discuss some of these studies, the potential candidate targets for neuroprotective therapies as well as the attempts to identify early biomarkers of progression and epileptogenesis, so as to implement therapies with early-onset disease-modifying effects.},

This review summarizes recent biochemical and functional data on the role of the {cGMP} signalling pathway in the mammalian brain, with a focus on the regulation of synaptic plasticity, learning, and other complex behaviours. Expression profiling, along with pharmacological and genetic manipulations, indicates important functions of nitric oxide ({NO})-sensitive soluble guanylyl cyclases ({sGCs}), {cGMP}-dependent protein kinases ({cGKs}), and {cGMP}-regulated phosphodiesterases ({PDEs}) as generators, effectors, and modulators of {cGMP} signals in the brain, respectively. In addition, neuronal {cGMP} signalling can be transmitted through cyclic nucleotide-gated ({CNG}) or hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated ({HCN}) ion channels. The canonical {NO}/{sGC}/{cGMP}/{cGK} pathway modulates long-term changes of synaptic activity in the hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum, and other brain regions, and contributes to distinct forms of learning and memory, such as fear conditioning, motor adaptation, and object recognition. Behavioural studies indicate that {cGMP} signalling is also involved in anxiety, addiction, and the pathogenesis of depression and schizophrenia. At the molecular level, different {cGK} isoforms appear to mediate effects of {cGMP} on presynaptic transmitter release and postsynaptic functions. The {cGKs} have been suggested to modulate cytoskeletal organization, vesicle and {AMPA} receptor trafficking, and gene expression via phosphorylation of various substrates including {VASP}, {RhoA}, {RGS}2, {hSERT}, {GluR}1, G-substrate, and {DARPP}-32. These and other components of the {cGMP} signalling cascade may be attractive new targets for the treatment of cognitive impairment, drug abuse, and psychiatric disorders.},

	abstract = {Many lines of evidence suggest that memory in the mammalian brain is stored with distinct spatiotemporal patterns. Despite recent progresses in identifying neuronal populations involved in memory coding, the synapse-level mechanism is still poorly understood. Computational models and electrophysiological data have shown that functional clustering of synapses along dendritic branches leads to nonlinear summation of synaptic inputs and greatly expands the computing power of a neural network. However, whether neighbouring synapses are involved in encoding similar memory and how task-specific cortical networks develop during learning remain elusive. Using transcranial two-photon microscopy, we followed apical dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the motor cortex while mice practised novel forelimb skills. Here we show that a third of new dendritic spines (postsynaptic structures of most excitatory synapses) formed during the acquisition phase of learning emerge in clusters, and that most such clusters are neighbouring spine pairs. These clustered new spines are more likely to persist throughout prolonged learning sessions, and even long after training stops, than non-clustered counterparts. Moreover, formation of new spine clusters requires repetition of the same motor task, and the emergence of succedent new spine(s) accompanies the strengthening of the first new spine in the cluster. We also show that under control conditions new spines appear to avoid existing stable spines, rather than being uniformly added along dendrites. However, succedent new spines in clusters overcome such a spatial constraint and form in close vicinity to neighbouring stable spines. Our findings suggest that clustering of new synapses along dendrites is induced by repetitive activation of the cortical circuitry during learning, providing a structural basis for spatial coding of motor memory in the mammalian brain.},

In one set of experiments a transversal microdialysis membrane was inserted in the dorsal hippocampus, drugs were administered intracerebroventricularly through a cannula implanted in the lateral ventricle, and {ACh} outflow in the dialysate was measured by an {HPLC} method with an electrochemical detector. The dialysis membrane was usually perfused with Ringer's solution containing 7 {microM} physostigmine sulfate. Intracerebroventricular injections of the {NMDA} antagonists 3-(({RS})-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid ({CPP}; 1-50 nmol), {MK}801 (0.5-20 nmol), and D(-)-2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid (100 nmol) brought about an increase in hippocampal {ACh} outflow while the non-{NMDA} antagonist 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (0.25-20 nmol) was without effect. The increase in {ACh} outflow following {CPP} administration was dose dependent and reached a maximum of about 500\%. It was abolished by {TTX} (0.5 {microM}) delivered locally to the hippocampus via the dialysis membrane and prevented by intracerebroventricular injection of the {GABA} agonist muscimol (5 nmol). In a second set of experiments, one microdialysis membrane was inserted in the dorsal hippocampus to detect {ACh} outflow and another in the septum to administer drugs locally and at the same time detect septal {GABA} outflow. The septal dialysis membrane was perfused with Ringer's solution without physostigmine, and {GABA} levels in the dialysate were measured by an {HPLC} method with a fluorescence detector. {CPP} (100 {microM}) perfused through the septum resulted in a decrease in septal {GABA} outflow and a concomitant increase in hippocampal {ACh} outflow. Muscimol (100 {microM}) administration into the septum abolished the effect of {CPP} on hippocampal {ACh} outflow but did not affect septal {GABA} outflow.

Although immunohistochemical studies, using pre-embedding techniques, have demonstrated that these receptors are abundant on {GABAergic} axon terminals, little is known about their exact location relative to the synapse. Here we used two recently developed antibodies against the {CB}1 receptor to study this question with the postembedding immunogold method, which allows the quantitative examination of receptor distribution along the axonal membrane, even within the synaptic active zone. {CB}1 receptor positive terminals target both the dendritic and somatic surface of neurons in the {CA}1 area of the rat hippocampus. We found no difference between these two populations of terminals either in their {CB}1 receptor density or in the distribution of receptors on their membrane. Recent studies suggest that endocannabinoids play a role in retrograde signaling at these synapses, i.e. signaling molecules diffuse from the postsynaptic membrane to nearby presynaptic terminals. Therefore, we examined the distribution of {CB}1 receptors on the terminal membranes. We found that they are rare in the synaptic active zone, but are enriched in the perisynaptic annulus, where they can directly influence synaptic calcium channels. Perisynaptic {CB}1 receptors represent about one tenth of all {CB}1 receptors in a terminal. In contrast, {CB}1 receptors have a lower density on the extrasynaptic membrane of terminals far from the postsynaptic cell. We estimated that these terminals contain exceptionally large numbers of {CB}1 receptors, i.e. a single axon terminal was usually labeled with more than 450 particles. An unexpected finding was that the density of {CB}1 receptors was significantly higher on preterminal axons than on synaptic terminals. These observations suggest that endocannabinoid signaling may subserve roles other than simply reducing transmitter release from axon terminals.},

	abstract = {{GABAergic} neurons are coextensive with cholinergic neurons in the medial septum-diagonal band complex. Serial sectioning, sequential staining and double immunofluorescence techniques employing antibodies to glutamate decarboxylase and choline acetyltransferase revealed the distribution of these transmitter-specific neurons in the rat. Morphologically, the two types of neurons appear similar, in that they are predominantly large multipolar cells, but they are characterized by different, overlapping distributions in the diagonal band. Glutamate decarboxylase-positive cells are scattered throughout the nucleus of the vertical limb of the diagonal band, while choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons are more numerous medially and are distributed in groups corresponding to the dorsal and ventral aspects of the nucleus. In the rostral parts of the nucleus of the horizontal limb of the diagonal band, the choline acetyltransferase-positive cells tend to be located medially, whereas caudally they spread dorsal to the nucleus to become continuous with other large cholinergic neurons in the ventral pallidum and sublenticular substantia innominata. The large majority of glutamate decarboxylase-positive neurons remain in a more ventral and lateral position within the nucleus of the horizontal limb and are particularly numerous just lateral to the diagonal band fibers as they join the medial forebrain bundle. Cholinergic neurons were estimated to be about two times more numerous than {GABAergic} neurons. Approximately 1\% of the choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons were also glutamate decarboxylase-positive in double immunofluorescence studies, but not in sequentially stained or serial sections.},

	abstract = {The electrophysiological observations that substance P administration to the lateral septal area elicits both excitatory and inhibitory responses, together with earlier reports on the multiple sources of substance P innervation of the septum, implies that these axons with distinct origins have different functions. This prompted us to examine the origin and neurochemical character of substance P afferents to the lateral septal area. Chronic surgical isolation of the septum from its ventral afferents and retrograde tracer experiments using wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase, both followed by an immunostaining for substance P, were employed to elucidate the origin of these axon terminals. In order to assess the possible co-existence of substance P with other neurotransmitter substances in the parent cells of the septopetal projections, co-localization studies for substance P and choline acetyltransferase, as well as substance P and {GABA}, were performed. The comparative distribution of substance P fibers and septal calbindin-containing neurons was also investigated using correlated light and electron microscopic double immunostaining. The results are summarized as follows: (i) the substance P innervation of the lateral septal area derives from several hypothalamic nuclei (including the lateral and lateroanterior hypothalamic area, tuber cinereum and ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus) and tegmental nuclei (the majority of fibers from the laterodorsal and a few from the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus), as well as intrinsic septal cells; (ii) the septopetal substance P fibers of tegmental origin are cholinergic; intraseptal substance P neurons located in the dorsolateral part of the lateral septum also contain {GABA}, while substance P neurons seen on the border between the medial and lateral septal area and septopetal hypothalamic substance P cells do not contain {GABA} or acetylcholine; (iii) substance P fibers from pericellular baskets around calbindin-containing lateral septal neurons with a high degree of selectivity; (iv) approximately 90\% of the entire calbindin cell population are postsynaptic targets of substance P axons; (v) their terminals contact the soma and the dendrites of these cells, among them the somatospiny neurons; and (vi) the extrinsic substance P boutons establish asymmetric, while the intrinsic substance P axon terminals form symmetric membrane specializations. Because neurons in the lateral septal area receive hippocampal input and project massively to hypothalamic areas, the different types of substance P input on these neurons can modify the information flow arriving from the hippocampus to diencephalic brain structures at the level of the lateral septal area.},

	abstract = {In recent years, {GABAergic} neurons have been identified in the basal forebrain where cholinergic cortically projecting neurons are located and known to be important in mechanisms of cortical activation. In the present study in the rat, the relationship of the {GABA}-synthesizing neurons to the acetylcholine-synthesizing neurons was examined by application of a sequential double staining immunohistochemical procedure involving the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique for glutamic acid decarboxylase ({GAD}) and choline acetyltransferase ({ChAT}). In these double and adjacent single immunostained series of sections, the {GAD}+ and {ChAT}+ cells were mapped, counted and measured with the aid of a computerized image analysis system. Through the entire basal forebrain, there was no evidence for colocalization of {GAD} and {ChAT} in the same neurons. Instead, a large population of {GAD}-immunoreactive neurons is codistributed with {ChAT}-immunoreactive neurons and outnumbers them by a factor of two: approximately 39,000 {GAD}+ cells to 18,000 {ChAT}+ cells. Although the {GAD}+ and {ChAT}+ neurons lie intermingled within fascicles of the major longitudinal and transverse forebrain fiber systems in subregions of the basal forebrain, the {GAD}+ cells are more highly concentrated within different sectors of the pathways and regions than the {ChAT}+ cells. Although {GAD}+ neurons resemble {ChAT}+ neurons in certain regions, both being bi- or multipolar and, on average, medium-sized cells, the {GAD}+ neurons are, in the majority (51\%), small-sized cells ({\textless} 15 microns in length) and as a population significantly smaller than the {ChAT}+ neurons. These results suggest that many {GABAergic} neurons may represent interneurons in the basal forebrain and potentially exert an inhibitory influence on adjacent cortically projecting cholinergic neurons. Medium- to large {GAD}+ cells, which resemble similar {ChAT}+ cells, are also present and represent the majority of the {GAD}+ cells in the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca, magnocellular preoptic nucleus, and olfactory tubercle, but represent the minority in the anterior and posterior substantia innominata and globus pallidus. Given their prominent size, such {GABAergic} cells may also exert an inhibitory influence outside the basal forebrain as projection neurons and potentially in parallel with cholinergic neurons, to certain regions of the cerebral cortex. Accordingly, {GABAergic} cells may be considered as constituents of the magnocellular basal nucleus and potentially important elements within the ventral extrathalamic relay from the brainstem reticular formation to the cerebral cortex.},

Slow firing neurons displayed a broad action potential followed by a prominent after-hyperpolarization. Burst firing neurons, when depolarized from hyperpolarized holding potentials, exhibited a high-frequency burst of spikes on the crest of a slow depolarizing potential. Fast firing neurons did not fire bursts of spikes when depolarized from hyperpolarized holding potentials. 3. Eighteen {MS}-{DB} neurons were identified as septohippocampal by antidromic activation. Of the septohippocampal neurons, four were slow firing neurons, five were burst firing neurons and nine were fast firing neurons. The mean axon conduction velocities of these neurons fell into two significant groups, termed slow conducting and fast conducting. Slow firing septohippocampal neurons had significantly slower conduction velocities than either fast firing or burst firing neurons (P {\textless} 0.05), being 0.7 +/- 0.5 ms-1 for slow firing neurons and 2.9 +/- 2.0 and 2.0 +/- 1.4 ms-1 for burst firing and fast firing neurons, respectively. 4. On the basis of previous evidence which has linked firing properties with the neurochemical identities of the neurons, we propose that the slow firing septohippocampal neurons are cholinergic whereas the burst firing and fast firing septohippocampal neurons are {GABAergic}.},

The cells were found to display a variety of bursting patterns phase-locked to hippocampal theta rhythm to a greater or lesser degree. Among phase-locked cells, no systematic distribution in preferential phase could be found, and these cells were shown to maintain their preferential phase for extended periods. Cells were classified into those which showed signs of a broadening of the repolarization phase of their action potential ('inflected': putative cholinergic) and those without ('non-inflected': putative {GABAergic}). Non-inflected cells tended to fire rhythmic bursts while inflected cells mostly fired in an irregular fashion, although still significantly phase-locked to hippocampal theta. In neither population did the phase-locked cells show any coherent distribution of their preferential phase. Sixty-five per cent of the rhythmically bursting cells showed a significant correlation between the interburst frequency and the animal's running speed. Five cells displayed rhythmic activity only when the rat ran in a specific direction. These results have implications for models of septohippocampal function and the effects of variable septal rhythmicity on the production of hippocampal theta rhythm.},

	abstract = {Nerve growth factor ({NGF}) has been implicated in maintaining and regulating normal functioning of the septohippocampal pathway. However, many aspects of its physiological actions and the underlying mechanisms await elucidation. In this study, we investigated the effect of acute {NGF} exposure on neurons in the mouse medial septum/diagonal band of Broca ({MS}/{DB}), focusing on the cholinergic neurons and the subpopulation of noncholinergic neurons that were identified to be putatively {GABAergic}. We report that {MS}/{DB} neurons in a thin slice preparation, when exposed to {NGF} via bath perfusion, rapidly and indiscriminately increased the rate of spontaneous firing in all {MS}/{DB} neurons. However, focal application of {NGF} to individual {MS}/{DB} neurons increased spontaneous firing in cholinergic, but not in the noncholinergic, subpopulation. The {NGF}-induced effect on cholinergic neurons was direct, requiring activation and signaling via {TrkA} receptors, which were immunohistochemically localized to the cholinergic neurons in the {MS}/{DB}. {TrkA} receptors were absent in putative {GABAergic} {MS}/{DB} neurons, and blockade of {TrkA} signaling in these and other noncholinergic neurons had no effect on their firing activity after exposure to {NGF}. Conversely, methyl scopolamine, blocked the increased firing activity of noncholinergic neurons during bath perfusion of {NGF}. We propose a cell type-specific mode of action for {NGF} in the {MS}/{DB}. The neurotrophin directly enhances cholinergic neuronal activity in the {MS}/{DB} through {TrkA}-mediated signaling, increasing acetylcholine release and, thus, muscarinic tone. This increase in muscarinic tone, in turn, results in heightened firing activity in noncholinergic {MS}/{DB} neurons.},

	abstract = {The medial septum-diagonal band ({MSDB}) complex is considered as a pacemaker for the hippocampal theta rhythm. Identification of the different cell types, their electro-physiological properties and their possible function in the generation of a synchronized activity in the {MSDB} is a hot topic. A recent electro-physiological study showed the presence of two antiphasically firing populations of parvalbumin containing {GABAergic} neurons in the {MSDB}. Other papers described a network of cluster-firing glutamatergic neurons, which is able to generate synchronized activity in the {MSDB}. We propose two different computer models for the generation of synchronized population theta oscillation in the {MSDB} and compare their properties. In the first model {GABAergic} neurons are intrinsically theta periodic cluster-firing cells; while in the second model {GABAergic} cells are fast-firing cells and receive periodic input from local glutamatergic neurons simulated as cluster-firing cells. Using computer simulations we show that the {GABAergic} neurons in both models are capable of generating antiphasic theta periodic population oscillation relying on local, septal mechanisms. In the first model antiphasic theta synchrony could emerge if {GABAergic} neurons form two populations preferentially innervate each other. In the second model in-phase synchronization of glutamatergic neurons does not require specific network structure, and the network of these cells are able to act as a theta pacemaker for the local fast-firing {GABAergic} circuit. Our simulations also suggest that neurons being non-cluster-firing in vitro might exhibit clustering properties when connected into a network in vivo.},

To understand the part that the cholinergic neurones might play in this activity, we sought to determine whether postsynaptic nicotinic receptor responses can be detected in slices of the rodent {MS}/{DB} by puffing on acetylcholine ({ACh}). Neurones were characterized electrophysiologically into {GABAergic} and cholinergic neurones according to previous criteria. Responses of the {MS}/{SB} neurones to {ACh} were various combinations of fast depolarizations (1.5-2.5 s), fast hyperpolarizations (3-4 s) and slow depolarizations (20-30 s), the latter two being blocked by atropine. The fast depolarizations were partially or not blocked with cadmium and low calcium, tetrodotoxin, and antagonists of other ionotropic receptors, and were antagonized with 25 microm mecamylamine. Pharmacological investigation of the responses showed that the alpha 7* nicotinic receptor type is associated with cholinergic neurones and 10\% of the {GABAergic} neurones, and that non alpha 7* nicotinic receptor subtypes are associated with 50\% of the {GABAergic} neurones. Pharmacological dissection of evoked and spontaneous postsynaptic responses, however, did not provide evidence for synaptic nicotinic receptor transmission in the {MS}/{DB}. It was concluded that nicotinic receptors, although prevalent on the somatic and/or dendritic membrane compartments of neurones in the {MS}/{DB}, are on extrasynaptic sites where they presumably play a neuromodulatory role. The presence of alpha 7* nicotinic receptors on cholinergic neurones may also render these cells specifically vulnerable to degeneration in Alzheimer's disease.},

	abstract = {The medial septum diagonal band complex ({MS}/{DB}) projects via cholinergic and {GABAergic} pathways to the hippocampus and plays a key role in the hippocampal theta rhythm. In the {MS}/{DB} we have previously described a population of fast spiking {GABAergic} neurons that contain parvalbumin and mediate theta frequency activity in vitro. The Kv3.1 potassium channel is a delayed rectifier channel that plays a major role in fast spiking neurons in the {CNS}, and has previously been localized in the {MS}/{DB}. To determine which cell types in the {MS}/{DB} express the Kv3.1b ion channel subunit, transgenic mice in which the expression of {GABAergic} and glutamate markers are associated with the expression of green fluorescent protein ({GFP}; {GAD}67-{GFP} and {VGluT}2-{GFP} mice, respectively) were used for immunofluorescence and axonal tract tracing. Electrophysiological studies were also carried out on rat {MS}/{DB} slices to examine the role of the Kv3.1 channel in theta frequency oscillations. The results for the {MS}/{DB} were as follows: (1) cholinergic cells did not express {GFP} in either {GAD}67-{GFP} or {VGluT}2-{GFP} mice, and there was {GAD}67 immunoreactivity in {GFP}-positive neurons in {GAD}67-{GFP} mice and in a small proportion (6\%) of {GFP}-positive neurons in {VGluT}2-{GFP} mice. (2) Kv3.1b immunofluorescence was associated with the somata of {GABAergic} neurons, especially those that contained parvalbumin, and with a minority of glutamatergic neurons, but not with cholinergic neurons, and with {GABAergic} axonal terminal-like processes around certain {GABAergic} neurons. (3) Both Kv3.1b-positive and -negative {GABAergic} neurons were septo-hippocampal, and there was a minor projection to hippocampus from {VGluT}2-{GFP} neurons. (4) Kainate-induced theta oscillations in the {MS}/{DB} slice were potentiated rather than inhibited by the Kv3.1 blocker 4-aminopyridine, and this agent on its own produced theta frequency oscillations in {MS}/{DB} slices that were reduced by ionotropic glutamate and {GABA} receptor antagonists and abolished by low extracellular calcium. These studies confirm the presence of heterogeneous populations of septo-hippocampal neurons in the {MS}/{DB}, and suggest that presence of Kv3.1 in the {GABAergic} neurons does not contribute to theta activity through fast spiking properties, but possibly by the regulation of transmitter release from axonal terminals.},

The aim of our study was to examine the presynaptic and postsynaptic locations of these receptors in the medial septal diagonal band area ({MS}/{DB}), an area known to pace the hippocampus theta rhythm. Whole-cell patch recordings were made from parasagittal {MS}/{DB} slices obtained from the 16-25 day rat. Neurons were classified into {GABAergic} and cholinergic subtypes according to previous electrophysiological criteria. Bath application of the {GABA}(B) receptor agonist baclofen in the presence of tetrodotoxin, and brief tetanic fiber stimulation in the presence of ionotropic receptor antagonists, provided evidence for the presence of postsynaptic {GABA}(B) receptor transmission to {GABAergic} but not cholinergic neurons. Bath application of baclofen, at concentrations too low to elicit postsynaptic activity in {MS}/{DB} neurons, significantly reduced the amplitudes of stimulus-evoked ionotropic receptor inhibitory postsynaptic potentials ({IPSPs}) and excitatory postsynaptic potentials ({EPSPs}) and the paired pulse depression of these evoked potentials. Baclofen also significantly reduced the frequencies but not the amplitudes of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents ({IPSCs}) and excitatory postsynaptic currents ({EPSCs}), indicating the presence of presynaptic {GABA}(B) receptors on {GABAergic} and glutamatergic terminals in the {MS}/{DB}. Baclofen, also at a concentration too low to elicit postsynaptic activity, reduced the frequencies and amplitudes of spontaneous {IPSCs} and {EPSCs} recorded in the presence of 200-400 {nM} kainate. Rhythmic compound {IPSCs} at theta frequencies were recorded under these conditions in some neurons, and these rhythmic compound {IPSCs} were disrupted by the activation but not by the inhibition of {GABA}(B) receptors. These results suggest that {GABA}(B) receptors modulate rather than generate rhythmic activity in the {MS}/{DB}, and that this modulatory effect occurs via receptors located on presynaptic terminals.},

The purpose of this study was to reveal the cholinergic neuronal changes in the medial septum (Ch1) and the nucleus of the vertical limb of the diagonal band (Ch2) of {DLB} brains. Using choline acetyltransferase ({ChAT}) immunohistochemistry, we showed that the number of {ChAT}-immunoreactive neurons in {DLB} brains was significantly lower than the numbers in {AD} and non-demented (control) brains. No significant difference in the number of {ChAT}-immunoreactive neurons was found between the {AD} and control brains. Moreover, the size of the {ChAT}-immunoreactive neurons was significantly smaller in the {AD} and {DLB} brains than in the control brains. These results show that cholinergic neurons of the Ch1-2 regions are more severely affected in {DLB} than in {AD}. Our {DLB} cases did not fulfill the neuropathologic criteria for definite {AD}. Furthermore, some Lewy bodies were observed in the Ch1-2 regions. Thus, cholinergic neuronal loss in the Ch1-2 regions might be specific to the pathology of {DLB}. Taking the distribution of cholinergic fibers in the hippocampus into consideration, this study suggests a possibility that hippocampal cholinergic projection is involved in Lewy-related neurites in the {CA}2-3 regions, the origin of which remains unclear.},

	abstract = {The septal region of the brain consists of a heterogeneous population of {GABAergic} neurons that play an important role in the generation of hippocampal theta rhythms. While {GABAergic} neurons employ two isoforms of the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase ({GAD}) for the synthesis of {GABA}, distribution of {GAD} isoforms has not been investigated in the septum. Immunohistochemical techniques were used to investigate the expression of {GAD} enzymes in medial and lateral septum. {GAD}65 and {GAD}67 immunohistochemistry revealed dense fibers and punctuated immunoreactivity in septal regions. While few {GAD}65-positive neuronal somas were detected in medial septum, a significantly higher number of immunoreactive neurons were detected in lateral septum. {GAD}65- and {GAD}67-positive neurons in the lateral septum exhibit higher complexity of dendritic arborizations than in the medial septum where staining was mainly restricted to the soma. Presumptive axon terminals (puncta) showed abundant immunoreactivity predominantly for {GAD}65 isoforms in all septal regions. This suggests that septal {GABAergic} neurons differentially express {GAD} enzymes thereby potentially reflecting functional differences. Differences found between medial and lateral septal {GABAergic} neuronal populations are in agreement with the concept that medial and lateral septum are brain structures with highly different connectivity and function despite anatomical proximity.},

Emulsion-coated sections revealed that {GAD}65 {mRNA}-containing neurons were at least six times more abundant in striatum than pallium, with only a uniformly scattered subpopulation labeled in pallium, and that the vast majority of the large scattered projection neurons of globus pallidus were heavily labeled for {GAD}65. Prominent labeling was also evident in the nucleus taeniae and subpallial amygdala, but not in the arcopallium in film autoradiograms. Within the diencephalon, the hypothalamus was more {GAD}65-rich than the thalamus. Additional subtelencephalic cell groups showing prominent labeling included the thalamic reticular nucleus and ventral lateral geniculate nucleus of the diencephalon, the nucleus pretectalis, subpretectalis and spiriformis lateralis of the pretectum, and the magnocellular isthmic nucleus of the optic lobe.

	abstract = {The early appearance and relative abundance of {GABAergic} neurons in basal forebrain cholinergic nuclei like the medial septum suggest that the maturation of the later developing cholinergic neurons in these nuclei may be controlled by {GABA}. To examine this possibility, the effects of both exogenous {GABA} and specific {GABA} receptor agonists, as well as that of endogenous {GABA} on the phenotypic expression and survival of the cholinergic neurons in primary cultures from the fetal rat medial septum, were studied. Treatment of these cultures for six days with {GABA} significantly decreased the enzymatic activity of choline acetyltransferase ({EC} 2.3.1.6) ({ChAT}) in a dose-dependent manner. This response to exogenous {GABA} was blocked by bicuculline, mimicked by muscimol and slightly potentiated by saclofen. Consistent with this latter observation, the {GABAB} receptor agonist, baclofen, dose-dependently increased septal {ChAT} activity. However, while the effect of baclofen on cholinergic expression was lost in the absence of glia, the suppressive effects of {GABA} or muscimol were more marked. Acetylcholinesterase ({EC} 3.1.1.7) ({AChE}) expression in mixed neuronal-glial cultures, was, like {ChAT} activity, increased or decreased in intensity with the inclusion of baclofen or muscimol, respectively. Although the number of {AChE} positive neurons in muscimol-treated cultures was significantly lower than that in controls, no changes in neither neuronal nor general cell viability were noted. Finally, as {GABAA} or {GABAB} receptor antagonists bicuculline and picrotoxin or saclofen, when applied alone to mixed cultures, increased or decreased {ChAT} activity, respectively, it appears that endogenous {GABA}, tonically released in the developing septum, may, via specific receptor types, differentially control the biochemical maturation of the cholinergic neurons.},

The {MSDB} lesion induced a marked deficit in the acquisition, but not in the retrieval, of eyeblink classical conditioning using a trace paradigm. Such a deficit was task-selective, as lesioned rats were able to acquire a fixed-interval operant conditioning as controls, and was not due to nonspecific motor alterations, because spontaneous locomotion and blink reflexes were not disturbed by the {MSDB} lesion. The deficit in the acquisition of a trace eyeblink classical conditioning was reverted by the systemic administration of carbachol, a nonselective cholinergic muscarinic agonist, but not by lobeline, a nicotinic agonist. These results suggest a key role of muscarinic denervation on the acquisition of new motor abilities using trace classical conditioning procedures. It might also be suggested that muscarinic agents would be useful for the amelioration of some associative learning deficits observed at early stages in patients with Alzheimer's disease.},

	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2882020},
	abstract = {Activity of neurones of the rat medial septal nucleus (m.s.) was recorded in in vitro slice preparations. The recorded population could be divided into low (less than 30 M omega)- and high-input-resistance (greater than 30 M omega) neurones. The high-resistance neurones tended to fire spontaneous action potentials and post-synaptic potentials. Some of the spontaneously active cells fired rhythmically at rates of 2-10 Hz. The rhythmicity disappeared following hyperpolarization of the recorded cell. The cells could fire repetitive Ca2+ spikes in the presence of tetrodotoxin ({TTX}) and intracellular Cs+. Cd2+ blocked this rhythmicity. Most of the m.s. cells had a non-linear voltage-current relation in both the hyperpolarizing and depolarizing directions. Hyperpolarizing rectification was selectively blocked by extracellular Cs+ whereas depolarizing rectification could be blocked by {TTX}. A recovery from hyperpolarization was associated in many cells with a transient depolarization (anodal break (a.b.) potential). A 20 ms 15 {mV} hyperpolarization could trigger an a.b. potential. The a.b. potential was reduced by {TTX} and Cs+ but not by Cd2+ or Mn2+. Depolarization of quiescent neurones triggered action potential discharges. A common pattern of discharge was a burst of two spikes which kept a fairly constant interspike interval. The second spike in a doublet could not follow a rate of 10 Hz depolarizing current pulses. It was also sensitive to topical application of Cd2+. It is therefore suggested that Ca2+ might be involved in the generation of the doublet. Long depolarizing current pulses produced trains of action potentials, showing little accommodation and little after-hyperpolarization, indicating that these cells possess little Ca2+-dependent K+ current. Many cells emitted spontaneous post-synaptic potentials at high rates. These could be blocked by picrotoxin. Stimulation of the lateral septal (l.s.) nucleus produced a Cl-dependent i.p.s.p. The i.p.s.p. was blocked by picrotoxin. Topical application of gamma-aminobutyric acid ({GABA}) produced a marked Cl(-)-dependent increase in conductance. It is suggested that l.s. projects a {GABA}-mediated inhibitory connexion to the m.s. Acetylcholine ({ACh}) depolarized m.s. neurones and caused an increase in input resistance. The response was present in {TTX} or Cd2+-containing medium. Atropine blocked responses to {ACh}. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-{HT}) hyperpolarized m.s. neurones in a manner consistent with an increase in K+ conductance. The effects of 5-{HT} were seen in {TTX}- and Cd2+-treated m.s. slices.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

In the control group, {GABA} significantly reduced bursts frequency in cells preserving their oscillatory activity, whereas in slices from the epileptic brain burst frequency increased under the action of {GABA}.

	abstract = {Extracellular metal microelectrodes are widely used to record single neuron activity in vivo. However, their signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}) is often far from optimal due to their high impedance value. It has been recently reported that carbon nanotube ({CNT}) coatings may decrease microelectrode impedance, thus improving their performance. To tease out the different contributions to {SNR} of {CNT}-coated microelectrodes we carried out impedance and noise spectroscopy measurements of platinum/tungsten microelectrodes coated with a polypyrrole-{CNT} composite. Neuronal signals were recorded in vivo from rat cortex by employing tetrodes with two recording sites coated with polypyrrole-{CNT} and the remaining two left untreated. We found that polypyrrole-{CNT} coating significantly reduced the microelectrode impedance at all neuronal signal frequencies (from 1 to 10 000 Hz) and induced a significant improvement of the {SNR}, up to fourfold on average, in the 150-1500 Hz frequency range, largely corresponding to the multiunit frequency band. An equivalent circuit, previously proposed for porous conducting polymer coatings, reproduced the impedance spectra of our coated electrodes but could not explain the frequency dependence of {SNR} improvement following polypyrrole-{CNT} coating. This implies that neither the neural signal amplitude, as recorded by a {CNT}-coated metal microelectrode, nor noise can be fully described by the equivalent circuit model we used here and suggests that a more detailed approach may be needed to better understand the signal propagation at the electrode-solution interface. Finally, the presence of significant noise components that are neither thermal nor electronic makes it difficult to establish a direct relationship between the actual electrode noise and the impedance spectra.},

Understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms of synapse formation is a key to understanding learning and memory.

Kalirin-7 interacts with multiple {PDZ}-domain-containing proteins including {PSD}95, spinophilin, and {GluR}1 through its {PDZ}-binding motif. In cultured hippocampal/cortical neurons, overexpression of Kalirin-7 increases spine density and spine size whereas reduction of endogenous Kalirin-7 expression decreases synapse number, and spine density. In Kalirin-7 knockout mice, spine length, synapse number, and postsynaptic density ({PSD}) size are decreased in hippocampal {CA}1 pyramidal neurons; these morphological alterations are accompanied by a deficiency in long-term potentiation ({LTP}) and a decreased spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current ({sEPSC}) frequency. Human Kalirin-7, also known as Duo or Huntingtin-associated protein-interacting protein ({HAPIP}), is equivalent to rat Kalirin-7. Recent studies show that Kalirin is relevant to many human diseases such as Huntington's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease, ischemic stroke, schizophrenia, depression, and cocaine addiction.

	abstract = {The influence of the medial septal nucleus and the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca ({MS}-{DB}) on the hippocampal theta rhythm includes both cholinergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid ({GABAergic}) components. To understand the intrinsic septal interactions and the separate contributions of the cholinergic and {GABAergic} septohippocampal neurons to the theta rhythm in behaving animals, it is essential to be able to identify these two classes from extracellular recordings. Here the durations of extracellularly recorded action potentials are compared with the other characteristics of the neurons. Extracellular recordings were taken from neurons of the {MS}-{DB} both in freely moving rats (114 cells) and in urethane-anesthetized rats (112 cells). These were compared with intracellular recordings taken from {MS}-{DB} neurons in urethane-anesthetized rats (58 cells). Hippocampal {EEG} was recorded from above the {CA}1 pyramidal cell layer ({CAI} theta) and near the hippocampal fissure (dentate theta) to compare the firing phase across cells. Here it is shown that two major types of rhythmically bursting cells in the {MS}-{DB} that had been distinguished previously in intracellular recordings in vivo are also separable in extracellular recordings in vivo on the basis of the durations of their action potentials. In both awake and anesthetized rats the main properties of the two cell types were found to differ: firing rate, phase-relation to the hippocampal theta rhythm and sensitivity of their rhythmicity to blockade of muscarinic transmission. As was previously shown for intracellular recordings in anesthetized rats, it is shown here that in awake rats, too, the more rapidly firing brief-spike (putative {GABAergic}) cells fired with highest probability on the negative phase of the dentate theta, whereas the more slowly firing long-spike (putative cholinergic) cells fired mostly on the positive phase. Previous work showed that in intracellular recordings from anesthetized rats the rhythmic firing of most brief-spike cells was still retained even during muscarinic blockade, but that of most long-spike cells was lost. Here we also report a recategorization according to spike duration of existing extracellular recordings taken from anesthetized rats, confirming the above observation with much larger numbers of cells. Three additional major new findings are also reported here. (1) In awake rats, muscarinic blockade has relatively little effect on either cell type. (2) Under anesthesia, the firing rates of both cell types are lower than in awake rats, but the effect is greater on the long-spike cells, where the anesthesia also reduces the rhythmicity of the cell firing. (3) Rhythmicity of the putative {GABAergic} cells is also retained after local injection of {GABA}-A antagonist, whereas that of the putative cholinergic cells is eliminated. We conclude that either systemic muscarinic blockade or urethane anesthesia alone have relatively little effect on neurons in the defined above {MS}-{DB}, but a combination of the two has profound effects on the rhythmicity of the cholinergic cells, largely sparing the {GABA}-ergic cells. Taken together, the results suggest that generation of theta rhythm requires a background of excitatory influences on the hippocampus (that can be maintained by either muscarinic or glutamatergic inputs) in combination with the phasic disinhibitory action mediated by the {GABAergic} {MS}-{DB} projection. They also provide additional support for the notion that the phasic activity in local collaterals of {GABAergic} {MS}-{DB} cells contributes to the phasic modulation of the firing of cholinergic septohippocampal neurons.},

To address this issue we studied the influences on {GABAergic} receptors in septal slices from the brain of epileptic guinea pigs compared to a control. In the epileptic brain, the overall increase in the mean frequency of neuronal discharges and the rise in the number of bursting neurons were revealed. The inhibitory action of exogenously applied {GABA} on neuronal activity is sharply enhanced, whereas the efficacy of action of {GABA}(A) and {GABA}(B) receptor blockers decreases, indicating the alteration of intraseptal inhibitory processes in epilepsy. In epilepsy, {GABA} sharply increases the oscillatory activity of the part of pacemakers, and the opposite effect was observed in the control. In epileptic animals, the {GABA} receptor blockers did not affect burst neurons, indicating the disturbance of the tonic {GABAergic} control of the oscillatory activity. Thus, we demonstrated for the first time that the activity of septal neurons and their reactions to {GABAergic} substances in animals with {TLE} model changed sharply compared to healthy ones.},

In the control, the bursts of spikes in one group of rhythmic {MSDB} neurons phase-locked to the top of theta waves in the hippocampus, and in the second group, to the trough of these waves. The stimulation evoked seizure afterdischarges in the hippocampus and seizure bursts of spikes separated by periods of inhibition in {MSDB} neurons. In the first group of septal cells, seizure bursts coincided with inhibitory periods between afterdischarges in the hippocampus; in the second group, these bursts were observed during seizure afterdischarges, suggesting that different {MSDB} cells play opposite roles in the development of seizures. Evoked afterdischarges were spontaneously followed by recurrent ictal events; neuronal oscillations at the theta (6-7 Hz) or "twice-theta" frequency (12-14 Hz) preceded these secondary epileptic discharges. As a result of kindling, interictal spikes were recorded in the hippocampus; at the same time, synchronous bursts of many cells appeared in the {MSDB}. In the epileptic brain, the frequency of both the hippocampal theta rhythm and {MSDB} neuronal theta bursts increased; in the septum, an augmentation of neuronal rhythmicity was also observed. Theta oscillations, either spontaneous or evoked by sensory stimulation, abolished the epileptiform events. Evidently, the activities within the theta range during preictal and interictal periods are of different significance in the generation of seizures.},

With the cloning of {NO} synthase and the physiological {NO} receptor soluble guanylyl cyclase, a variety of histochemical methods quickly led to a rather complete picture of where {NO} is produced and acts in the nervous system. However, the details regarding the subcellular localization of {NO} synthase and the identity of its molecular binding partners require further clarification. Although the hypothesis that calcium influx via activation of {NMDA} receptors is a key trigger for {NO} production has proven very popular and led to suggested roles for {NO} in synaptic plasticity, there is little direct evidence to support this notion. Instead, studies from the peripheral nervous system indicate a key role for voltage-sensitive calcium channels in regulating {NO} synthase activity. A similar mechanism may also be important in central neurons, and it remains an important task to identify the precise sources of calcium regulating {NO} production in specific {NO} neurons. Also, although {cGMP} production appears to mediate the physiological signaling by {NO}, the specific roles of {cGMP}-dependent ion channels, protein kinases and phosphodiesterases in mediating {NO} action remain to be determined.},

	abstract = {Status epilepticus ({SE}) in humans and animal models results in significant cerebral damage and an increased risk of subsequent seizures, associated with a characteristic pattern of neuronal loss particularly affecting the hippocampus. Seizure related cell death is considered to be excitotoxic, but studies have been limited, concentrating on terminal events rather than initial mechanisms. We have studied the biochemical events in the first few days following {SE}. Self-sustaining limbic {SE} was induced in adult rats using perforant path stimulation, and animals were allowed to recover. Biochemical studies were performed at 16, 44 h and 8 days following {SE}, using spectrophotometric enzyme assays and {HPLC} on regional brain homogenates compared with those from sham-operated controls. Haematoxylin and eosin histology was also undertaken at each time point. Brain aconitase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase ({alphaKDH}) activity were both significantly (P{\textless}0.05) reduced by approximately 20\% in the first 16-44 h following status, but had returned to normal by 8 days. These enzymes are part of the tri-carboxylic acid (Krebbs) cycle in the mitochondrial matrix, and are known to be sensitive to free radical, especially peroxynitrite damage. There was a similar decrease in reduced glutathione levels. Histological studies confirmed evidence of acute neuronal damage up to 44 h, and neuronal loss by 8 days. This is the first in vivo demonstration of this pattern of mitochondrial dysfunction and loss of brain glutathione following {SE}. The pattern of abnormalities is consistent with reversible mechanisms being involved in excitotoxic cell damage. This, together with the timing of changes, suggests new avenues for therapeutic intervention.},

The compartmentation of glutamate in brain cells is complex and modulated by the presence and concentration of glutamate per se as well as by other metabolites. Both astrocytes and neurons distinguish between exogenous glutamate and glutamate formed endogenously from glutamine via glutaminase. There is evidence of multiple subcellular compartments of glutamate within both neurons and astrocytes, and the carbon skeleton of glutamate can be derived from other amino acids and many energy substrates including glucose, lactate, and 3-hydroxybutyrate. Both astrocytes and neurons utilize glutamate, albeit for cell-specific metabolic fates. Glutamate is readily formed in neurons from glutamine synthesized in astrocytes, released into the extracellular space, and taken up by neurons. However, the glutamate-glutamine cycle is not a stoichiometric cycle but rather an open pathway that interfaces with many other metabolic pathways to varying extents depending on cellular requirements and priorities.},

	abstract = {Endocannabinoid signaling is a key regulator of synaptic neurotransmission throughout the brain. Compelling evidence shows that its perturbation leads to development of epileptic seizures, thus indicating that endocannabinoids play an intrinsic protective role in suppressing pathologic neuronal excitability. To elucidate whether long-term reorganization of endocannabinoid signaling occurs in epileptic patients, we performed comparative expression profiling along with quantitative electron microscopic analysis in control (postmortem samples from subjects with no signs of neurological disorders) and epileptic (surgically removed from patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy) hippocampal tissue. Quantitative {PCR} measurements revealed that {CB}(1) cannabinoid receptor {mRNA} was downregulated to one-third of its control value in epileptic hippocampus. Likewise, the cannabinoid receptor-interacting protein-1a {mRNA} was decreased, whereas 1b isoform levels were unaltered. Expression of diacylglycerol lipase-alpha, an enzyme responsible for 2-arachidonoylglycerol synthesis, was also reduced by approximately 60\%, whereas its related beta isoform levels were unchanged. Expression level of N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine-hydrolyzing phospholipase D and fatty acid amide hydrolase, metabolic enzymes of anandamide, and 2-arachidonoylglycerol's degrading enzyme monoacylglycerol lipase did not change. The density of {CB}(1) immunolabeling was also decreased in epileptic hippocampus, predominantly in the dentate gyrus, where quantitative electron microscopic analysis did not reveal changes in the ratio of {CB}(1)-positive {GABAergic} boutons, but uncovered robust reduction in the fraction of {CB}(1)-positive glutamatergic axon terminals. These findings show that a neuroprotective machinery involving endocannabinoids is impaired in epileptic human hippocampus and imply that downregulation of {CB}(1) receptors and related molecular components of the endocannabinoid system may facilitate the deleterious effects of increased network excitability.},

Moreover, recent evidence points to a more pronounced regulatory role of the tricarboxylic acid cycle than hitherto anticipated in the biosynthetic machinery responsible for formation of {GABA} from glutamine. Additionally, {GABAergic} neurons may contain distinct populations of mitochondria having different turnover rates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle with different levels of association with {GABA} synthesis from 2-oxoglutarate via glutamate.

The burst firing associated with prolonged epileptic discharges could lead to a large number of changes and cascades of events at the cellular level. From its role as the cellular powerhouse, the mitochondrion is emerging as a key participant in cell death because of its association with an ever-growing list of apoptosis-related proteins. Prolonged seizures may result in the mitochondrial dysfunction and increased production of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide ({NO}) precede neuronal cell death and cause subsequent epileptogenesis. Emerging evidences also showed that intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway may contribute to the neuropathology of human epilepsy, particularly in the hippocampus. Subsequent laboratory studies in the animal model of status epilepticus provide credence to the notion that activation of nuclear factor-κB upregulates {NO} synthase ({NOS}) {II} gene expression with temporal correlation of {NOS} {II} derived {NO}-, superoxide anion- and peroxynitrite-dependent reduction in mitochondrial Complex I activity, leading to apoptotic neuronal cell death in the hippocampus. These results will broaden our understanding on the intimate link between mitochondrial function, oxidative stress and mitochondria-dependent apoptotic signaling triggered by epileptic seizures. It will open a new vista in the development of more effective neuroprotective strategies against seizure-induced brain damage by modification of bioenergetic failure in the mitochondria and in the design of novel treatment perspectives for therapy-resistant forms of epilepsy.},

We report here that three recently cloned rat glutamate transporter subtypes, viz. {EAAC}1 (neuronal), {GLT}1 and {GLAST} (glial), possess a redox-sensing property, undergoing opposite functional changes in response to oxidation or reduction of reactive sulphydryls present in their structure. In particular, thiol oxidation with 5,5'-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic) acid ({DTNB}) and disulphide reduction with dithiothreitol ({DTT}) result, respectively, in reduced and increased uptake capacity by a preparation of partially purified brain transporters as well as by the three recombinant proteins reconstituted into liposomes. In this model system, {EAAC}1, {GLT}1 and {GLAST} react similarly to {DTT}/{DTNB} exposures despite their different contents of cysteines, suggesting that only the conserved residues might be involved in redox modulation. Redox sensitivity is a property of the glutamate transporters also when present in their native cell environment. Thus, by using cultured cortical astrocytes and the whole-cell patch-clamp technique we were able to observe dynamic increase and decrease of the glutamate uptake current in response to application of {DTT} and {DTNB} in sequence. Moreover, in the same paradigm, {DDT}-reversible current inhibition was observed with hydrogen peroxide instead of {DTNB}, indicating that the {SH}-based redox modulatory site is targeted by endogenous oxidants and might constitute an important physiological or pathophysiological regulatory mechanism of glutamate uptake in vivo.},

Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are emerging as factors that not only occur acutely as a result of precipitating injuries such as status epilepticus ({SE}), but may also contribute to epileptogenesis and chronic epilepsy. Mitochondria are the primary site of reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) making them uniquely vulnerable to oxidative damage that may affect neuronal excitability and seizure susceptibility.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Impaired auditory gating and abnormal neuronal synchrony are indicators of dysfunctional information processing in schizophrenia patients and possible underlying mechanisms of their impaired sensory and cognitive functions. Because cannabinoid receptors and endocannabinoids have been linked to psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of cannabinoid-1 ({CB}1) receptor activation on sensory gating and neuronal oscillations in rats.


{METHODS}

Auditory sensory gating has been recorded from the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex ({EC}) in anesthetized rats. Neuronal network oscillations were recorded from the hippocampus, medial septum, {EC}, and medial prefrontal cortex in anesthetized and freely moving rats. Effects of systemic administration of {CB}1 receptor agonist {CP}-55940 were evaluated on these parameters.


{RESULTS}

{CP}-55940 significantly disrupted auditory gating both in the hippocampus and {EC} in anesthetized rats. Theta field potential oscillations were disrupted in the hippocampus and {EC}, with simultaneous interruption of theta-band oscillations of septal neurons. Administration of the {CB}1 receptor antagonist {AM}-251 reversed both the agonist-induced gating deficit and the diminished oscillations. In freely moving rats, {CP}-55940 significantly reduced theta and gamma power in the hippocampus, whereas in the {EC}, only gamma power was attenuated. However, novelty-induced theta and gamma activities were significantly diminished by {CP}-55940 in both the hippocampus and {EC}.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Our data indicate that activation of {CB}1 receptors interferes with neuronal network oscillations and impairs sensory gating function in the limbic circuitry, further supporting the connection between cannabis abuse and increased susceptibility of developing schizophrenia spectrum disorders.},

	abstract = {The sudden interruption of an intracortical instillation of exogenous gamma-aminobutyric acid ({GABA}) generates an epileptic focus in mammals. Seizures elicited by {GABA} withdrawal ({GW}) last for weeks. A similar withdrawal-induced hyperexcitability is also produced by several {GABA}(A) receptor agonists. This work reports a quantitative analysis of {GW}-induced hyperexcitability produced in the hippocampus in vitro. {GW} produced a left-ward displacement of the input/output (I/O) function, suggesting that the postsynaptic component is predominant to explain the hyperexcitability. A decrease in the inhibitory efficacy of the {GABA}(A) receptor agonist, muscimol, confirmed that inhibition was impaired. Binding saturation experiments demonstrated a decrease in [(3)H]-muscimol binding after {GABA} withdrawal showing a close correlation with the development of hyperexcitability. All these modifications coursed without changes in receptor affinity (K(D)) for muscimol or bicuculline as demonstrated by both binding studies and Schild analysis. It is concluded that, in the {CA}1 region of the hippocampus, it is the number of functional {GABA}(A) receptors, and not the affinity of the receptor, what is decreased during {GW}-induced hyperexcitability.},

Here, we present evidence against these common misconceptions. Rather than a uniform disorder, spike-wave rhythms arise from the normal inherent network properties of brain excitatory and inhibitory circuits, where they can be provoked by many different insults in several different brain networks. Here we discuss several different cellular and molecular mechanisms that may contribute to the generation of spike-wave seizures, particularly in idiopathic generalized epilepsy. In addition, we discuss growing evidence that electrical, neuroimaging, and molecular changes in spike-wave seizures do not involve the entire brain homogeneously. Rather, spike-wave discharges occur selectively in some thalamocortical networks, while sparing others. It is hoped that improved understanding of the heterogeneous defects and selective brain regions involved will ultimately lead to more effective treatments for spike-wave seizures.},

Iontophoretic injection of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin into the medial septum and the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca or the lateral entorhinal cortex showed contacts between Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin immunopositive en passant and terminal boutons and surviving calcium binding protein immunopositive neurons in the hippocampus. The presence in the gliotic hippocampus of enlarged and/or aggregated bouton-like structures 60 days after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus is indicative for the reorganization of connections between the hippocampal afferents and surviving hippocampal neurons.

	abstract = {The medial septum/diagonal band region, which participates in learning and memory processes via its cholinergic and {GABAergic} projection to the hippocampus, is one of the structures affected by beta amyloid ({betaA}) deposition in Alzheimer's disease ({AD}). The acute effects of {betaA} (25-35 and 1-40) on action potential generation and glutamatergic synaptic transmission in slices of the medial septal area of the rat brain were studied using current and patch-clamp techniques. The {betaA} mechanism of action through M1 muscarinic receptors and voltage-dependent calcium channels was also addressed. Excitatory evoked responses decreased (30-60\%) in amplitude after {betaA} (2 {microM}) perfusion in 70\% of recorded cells. However, the firing properties were unaltered at the same concentration. This depression was irreversible in most cases, and was not prevented or reversed by nicotine (5 {microM}). In addition, the results obtained using a paired-pulse protocol support pre- and postsynaptic actions of the peptide. The {betaA} effect was blocked by calcicludine (50 {nM}), a selective antagonist of L-type calcium channels, and also by blocking muscarinic receptors with atropine (5 {muM}) or pirenzepine (1 {microM}), a more specific M1-receptor blocker. We show that in the medial septal area this oligomeric peptide acts through calcium channels and muscarinic receptors. As blocking any of these pathways blocks the {betaA} effects, we propose a joint action through both mechanisms. These results may contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology at the onset of {AD}. This understanding will be required for the development of new therapeutic agents.},

	abstract = {In the brain, tachykinins acting via the three cloned neurokinin ({NK}) receptors are implicated in stress-related affective disorders. Hemokinin-1 is a novel tachykinin that reportedly prefers {NK}1 to {NK}2 or {NK}3 receptors. Although {NK}1 and {NK}3 receptors are abundantly expressed in the brain, {NK}2-receptor-mediated electrophysiological effects have rarely been described as {NK}2 receptors are expressed only in a few brain regions such as the nucleus of the medial septum/diagonal band. Medial septal/diagonal band neurons that control hippocampal mnemonic functions also colocalize {NK}1 and {NK}3 receptors. Functionally, intraseptal activation of all three {NK} receptors increases hippocampal acetylcholine release and {NK}2 receptors have specifically been implicated in stress-induced hippocampal acetylcholine release. Electrophysiological studies on the effects of {NKs} on septohippocampal cholinergic neurons are lacking and electrophysiological effects of hemokinin-1 have thus far not been reported in brain neurons. In the present study we examined the electrophysiological and pharmacological effects of multiple {NKs} on fluorescently tagged septohippocampal cholinergic neurons using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in a rat brain slice preparation. We demonstrate that a vast majority of septohippocampal cholinergic cells are activated by {NK}1, {NK}2 and {NK}3 receptor agonists as well as by hemokinin-1 via direct post-synaptic mechanisms. Pharmacologically, hemokinin-1 recruits not only {NK}1 but also {NK}2 and {NK}3 receptors to activate septohippocampal cholinergic neurons that are the primary source of acetylcholine for the hippocampus.},

	abstract = {The septal region of the basal forebrain plays a critical role modulating hippocampal excitability and functional states. Septal circuits may also play a role in controlling abnormal hippocampal hyperexcitability in epilepsy. Both lateral and medial septal neurons are targets of hippocampal axons. Since the hippocampus is an important epileptogenic area in temporal lobe epilepsy, we hypothesize that excessive excitatory output will promote sustained neurodegeneration of septal region neurons. Pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus ({SE}) was chosen as a model to generate chronic epileptic animals. To determine whether septal neuronal populations are affected by hippocampal seizures, immunohistochemical assays were performed in brain sections obtained from age-matched control, latent period (7 days post-{SE}) and chronically epileptic (more than one month post-{SE} survival) rats. An anti-{NeuN} (neuronal nuclei) antibody was used to study total neuronal numbers. Anti-{ChAT} (choline acetyltransferase), anti-{GAD} (glutamic acid decarboxylase) isoenzymes (65 and 67), and anti-glutamate antibodies were used to reveal cholinergic, {GABAergic} and glutamatergic neurons, respectively. Our results revealed a significant atrophy of medial and lateral septal areas in all chronically epileptic rats. Overall neuronal density in the septum (medial and lateral septum), assessed by {NeuN} immunoreactivity, was significantly reduced by approximately 40\% in chronically epileptic rats. The lessening of neuronal numbers in both regions was mainly due to the loss of {GABAergic} neurons (80-97\% reduction in medial and lateral septum). In contrast, populations of cholinergic and glutamatergic neurons were spared. Overall, these data indicate that septal {GABAergic} neurons are selectively vulnerable to hippocampal hyperexcitability, and suggest that the processing of information in septohippocampal networks may be altered in chronic epilepsy.},

Here we evaluated the histochemical and behavioral effects of a selective lesion of {BFCNs} in C57BL/6J mice treated intracerebroventricularly ({ICV}) with a novel version of the immunotoxin mu p75-saporin (0.4 mug/mouse). There was a 100\% postsurgical survival rate, no abnormal loss of weight, no disruption of sensorimotor coordination, and no noncognitive bias in a water-maze test. This immunotoxin induced a loss of choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons in the medial septum (-82\%) and in the nucleus basalis (-55\%). Preserved parvalbumine-immunostaining suggests that the lesion was specific to {BFCNs}. Septo-hippocampal and basalo-cortical projections of {BFCNs} degenerated as suggested by massive loss of acetylcholinesterase-positive staining in the hippocampus and the cortical mantle. Moreover, anticalbindin immunostaining showed no damage to cerebellar Purkinje cells. Lesioned mice displayed increased diurnal and nocturnal locomotor activity. Their spatial learning/memory performances in a water maze and in a Barnes maze were significantly impaired: learning was substantially slowed down, although not obliterated, and memory retention was altered. These behavioral consequences are comparable, with fewer side effects, to those reported after {ICV} 192 {IgG}-saporin in rats. In conclusion, the new version of mu p75-saporin provides a safe and powerful tool for {BFCN} lesion in mice.},

In particular, they seem to be important for the development of cholinergic neurons in various brain regions. Here, we applied a genetic approach to investigate the role of the glucocorticoid receptor ({GR}) on the maturation and maintenance of cholinergic medial septal neurons between P15 and one year of age by using a mouse model carrying a {CNS}-specific conditional inactivation of the {GR} gene ({GRNesCre}). The number of choline acetyltransferase and p75NTR immuno-positive neurons in the medial septum ({MS}) was analyzed by stereology in controls versus mutants. In addition, cholinergic fiber density, acetylcholine release and cholinergic key enzyme activity of these neurons were determined in the hippocampus. We found that in {GRNesCre} animals the number of medial septal cholinergic neurons was significantly reduced during development. In addition, cholinergic cell number further decreased with aging in these mutants. The functional {GR} gene is therefore required for the proper maturation and maintenance of medial septal cholinergic neurons. However, the loss of cholinergic neurons in the medial septum is not accompanied by a loss of functional cholinergic parameters of these neurons in their target region, the hippocampus. This pinpoints to plasticity of the septo-hippocampal system, that seems to compensate for the septal cell loss by sprouting of the remaining neurons.},

Using tyrosine hydroxlase ({TH}) immunocytochemistry and dark-field light microscopy, we found that the {MS}/{vDB} is innervated by a sparse network of {TH}-immunoreactive (putative catecholaminergic) terminals. {MS}/{vDB} neurons are known to fire in rhythmic theta burst frequency of 3-7 Hz to pace hippocampal theta rhythm. Extracellular single-unit recording in theta and non-theta firing {MS}/{vDB} neurons and antidromically identified {MS}/{vDB}-hippocampal neurons were made in urethan-anesthetized rats. Tail-pinch noxious stimuli and ventral tegmental area ({VTA}) stimulation (20 Hz) evoked spontaneous theta burst firing in {MS}/{vDB} neurons. Systemic D1/5 antagonists {SCH}23390 or {SCH}39166 (0.1 mg/kg iv) alone suppressed the spontaneous theta bursts, suggesting a tonic facilitatory endogenous dopamine D1 "tone" that modulates theta bursts in vivo. Activation of D1/5 receptor by dihydrexidine (10 mg/kg iv) led to an increase in mean firing rate in 60\% of all theta and non-theta {MS}/{vDB} neurons with an increase in the number of theta bursts and spikes/burst in theta cells. In strong theta firing {MS}/{vDB} neurons, D1/5 receptor stimulation suppressed the occurrence of theta burst firing, whereas the overall increase in spontaneous mean firing rate remained. In low baseline theta {MS}/{vDB} neurons D1/5 receptor stimulation increases the occurrence of theta bursts along with a net increase in mean firing rate. Atropine injection consistently disrupts theta burst pattern and reduced the time spent in theta firing. Collectively, these data suggest that dopamine D1/5 stimulation enhances the mean firing rate of most {MS}/{vDB} neurons and also provides a state-dependent bidirectional modulation of theta burst occurrence. Some of these {MS}/{vDB} neurons may be cholinergic or {GABAergic} that may indirectly regulate theta rhythm in the hippocampus.},

	abstract = {Neurons in the supramammillary nucleus ({SUM}) of urethane-anesthetized rats fire rhythmically in synchrony with hippocampal theta rhythm. As these neurons project to the septum and hippocampus, it is generally assumed that their role is to mediate ascending activation, leading to the hippocampal theta rhythm. However, the connections between {SUM} and the septohippocampal system are reciprocal; there is strong evidence that theta remains in the hippocampus after {SUM} lesions and in the {SUM} after lesioning the medial septum. The present study examines the dynamics of coupling between rhythmic discharge in the {SUM} and hippocampal field potential oscillations, using the directionality information carried by the two signals. Using directed transfer function analysis, we demonstrate that during sensory-elicited theta rhythm and also during short episodes of theta acceleration of spontaneous oscillations, the spike train of a subpopulation of {SUM} neurons contains information predicting future variations in rhythmic field potentials in the hippocampus. In contrast, during slow spontaneous theta rhythm, it is the {SUM} spike signal that can be predicted from the preceding segment of the electrical signal recorded in the hippocampus. These findings indicate that, in the anesthetized rat, {SUM} neurons effectively drive theta oscillations in the hippocampus during epochs of sensory-elicited theta rhythm and short episodes of theta acceleration, whereas spontaneous slow theta in the {SUM} is controlled by descending input from the septohippocampal system. Thus, in certain states, rhythmically firing {SUM} neurons function to accelerate the septal theta oscillator, and in others, they are entrained by a superordinate oscillatory network.},

Although cholinergic and {GABAergic} {MS}-{DBB} neurons are known to modulate hippocampal activity, the role of recently described glutamatergic {MS}-{DBB} neurons is unknown. Here, we examined the electrophysiological properties of glutamatergic {MS}-{DBB} neurons and tested whether they provide a functional synaptic input to the hippocampus. To visualize the glutamatergic neurons, we used {MS}-{DBB} slices from transgenic mice in which the green fluorescent protein is expressed specifically by vesicular glutamate transporter 2-positive neurons and characterized their properties using whole-cell patch-clamp technique. For assessing the function of the glutamatergic projection, we used an in vitro septohippocampal preparation, electrically stimulated the fornix or chemically activated the {MS}-{DBB} using {NMDA} microinfusions and recorded postsynaptic responses in {CA}3 pyramidal cells. We found that glutamatergic {MS}-{DBB} neurons as a population display a highly heterogeneous set of firing patterns including fast-, cluster-, burst-, and slow-firing. Remarkably, a significant proportion exhibited fast-firing properties, prominent I(h), and rhythmic spontaneous firing at theta frequencies similar to those found in {GABAergic} {MS}-{DBB} neurons. Activation of the {MS}-{DBB} led to fast, {AMPA} receptor-mediated glutamatergic responses in {CA}3 pyramidal cells. These results describe for the first time the electrophysiological signatures of glutamatergic {MS}-{DBB} neurons, their rhythmic firing properties, and their capacity to drive hippocampal principal neurons. Our findings suggest that the glutamatergic septohippocampal pathway may play an important role in hippocampal theta oscillations and relevant cognitive functions.},

Double-labelling experiments revealed that these four antigen-containing cells formed distinct dorsoventrally running lamellae overlayed on top of each other similar to onion leaves. There was only a slight overlapping of the various cell groups. None of the four antigens were co-localized in the same cells. The lamella occupied by calretinin-positive neurons is situated at the border of the medial septum and the intermediolateral septal nucleus, and shows some overlap with the area occupied by cholinergic neurons. Retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase from the hippocampus combined with immunostaining for calretinin revealed that calretinin-containing neurons do not participate in the septohippocampal projection. The lack of projection to the amygdala was also confirmed. Thus, calretinin-containing neurons represent a distinct cell group in the medial septal region, which either projects to subcortical areas, or may function as interneurons relaying hippocampal feedback to the medial septal projection neurons.},

	abstract = {Glutamatergic influence on the medial septum diagonal band of Broca complex ({MSDB}) is a crucial and powerful driver of hippocampal theta rhythm and associated memory processes, in the rat. The recent discovery of vesicular glutamate transporters ({VGLUT}) provided a specific marker for glutamatergic neuronal elements. Therefore, this study aimed to address two specific questions: (1) do glutamatergic axons innervate {MSDB} gamma-aminobutyric acid ({GABA})ergic, parvalbumin ({PV})-containing septohippocampal neurons that are known to have a great influence on the electric activity of the hippocampus; and (2) is the origin of these glutamatergic axons extrinsic and/or intrinsic to the septum. The results of the correlated light and electron microscopic double-labeling immunohistochemistry for {VGLUT}2 and {PV}, and single immunostaining for {VGLUT}2 in colchicine-treated animals, showed that (1) {VGLUT}2-containing boutons establish asymmetric synaptic contacts with {PV}-positive perikarya and dendrites; (2) a large population of {VGLUT}2-immunoreactive neurons is located primarily in the posterior division of the septum; and (3) following surgical fimbria/fornix transection and septal undercut, most {VGLUT}2-containing axons, including those terminating on {MSDB} {PV} cells, remains intact. The latter two observations suggest that the major portion of {MSDB} glutamate axons have an intraseptal origin and raise a novel functional aspect of glutamatergic cells as local circuit neurons. A constant impulse flow in the septohippocampal {GABA} pathway is essential for the generation of theta rhythm. Thus, the heavy glutamatergic innervation of these septohippocampal {GABA} cells establishes the morphological basis for the powerful glutamatergic influence upon theta rhythm and hippocampus-associated memory processes.},

Axon collaterals of these neurons also release acetylcholine within the septum and thereby maintain the firing activity of septohippocampal {GABAergic} neurons. A loss of septohippocampal cholinergic neurons occurs in various neurodegenerative disorders associated with cognitive dysfunctions. group I metabotropic glutamate receptors have been implicated in septohippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks. In the present study, we examined the physiological and pharmacological effects of a potent and selective group I metabotropic glutamate receptor ({mGluR}) agonist S-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine ({DHPG}) on rat septohippocampal cholinergic neurons that were identified in brain slices using a selective fluorescent marker. In whole cell recordings, {DHPG} produced a reversible, reproducible and a direct postsynaptic and concentration-dependent excitation in 100\% of septohippocampal cholinergic neurons tested with an {EC}(50) of 2.1 {microM}. Pharmacologically, the effects of {DHPG} were partially/completely reduced by the {mGluR}1 antagonists, 7-hydrox-iminocyclopropan[b]chromen-1a-carboxylic acid ethyl ester and (+)-2-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine. Addition of the {mGluR}5 antagonist, 2-methyl-6-(phenylethnyl)pyridine hydrochloride, reduced the remaining response to {DHPG}, suggesting involvement of both receptor subtypes in a subpopulation of septohippocampal cholinergic neurons. In double-immunolabeling studies, 74\% of septohippocampal cholinergic neurons co-localized {mGluR}1alpha-immunoreactivity and 35\% co-localized {mGluR}5-immunoreactivity. Double-immunolabeling studies at the light and electron-microscopic levels showed that vesicular glutamate transporter 2 terminals make asymmetric synaptic contacts with septohippocampal cholinergic neurons. These findings may be of significance in treatment of cognitive deficits associated with neurodegenerative disorders as a group I {mGluR}-mediated activation of septohippocampal cholinergic neurons would enhance the release of acetylcholine both in the hippocampus and in the septum.},

	abstract = {The basal forebrain ({BF}) plays an important role in modulating cortical activity and influencing attention, learning and memory. These activities are fulfilled importantly yet not entirely by cholinergic neurons. Noncholinergic neurons also contribute and comprise {GABAergic} neurons and other possibly glutamatergic neurons. The aim of the present study was to estimate the total number of cells in the {BF} of the rat and the proportions of that total represented by cholinergic, {GABAergic} and glutamatergic neurons. For this purpose, cells were counted using unbiased stereological methods within the medial septum, diagonal band, magnocellular preoptic nucleus, substantia innominata and globus pallidus in sections stained for Nissl substance and/or the neurotransmitter enzymes, choline acetyltransferase ({ChAT}), glutamic acid decarboxylase ({GAD}) or phosphate-activated glutaminase ({PAG}). In Nissl-stained sections, the total number of neurons in the {BF} was estimated as approximately 355,000 and the numbers of {ChAT}-immuno-positive (+) as approximately 22,000, {GAD}+ approximately 119,000 and {PAG}+ approximately 316,000, corresponding to approximately 5\%, approximately 35\% and approximately 90\% of the total. Thus, of the large population of {BF} neurons, only a small proportion has the capacity to synthesize acetylcholine ({ACh}), one third to synthesize {GABA} and the vast majority to synthesize glutamate (Glu). Moreover, through the presence of {PAG}, a proportion of {ACh}- and {GABA}-synthesizing neurons also has the capacity to synthesize Glu. In sections dual fluorescent immunostained for vesicular transporters, vesicular glutamate transporter ({VGluT}) 3 and not {VGluT}2 was present in the cell bodies of most {PAG}+ and {ChAT}+ and half the {GAD}+ cells. Given previous results showing that {VGluT}2 and not {VGluT}3 was present in {BF} axon terminals and not colocalized with {VAChT} or {VGAT}, we conclude that the {BF} cell population influences cortical and subcortical regions through neurons which release {ACh}, {GABA} or Glu from their terminals but which in part can also synthesize and release Glu from their soma or dendrites.},

	abstract = {Brain microdialysis has become a frequently used method to study the extracellular concentrations of neurotransmitters in specific areas of the brain. For years, and this is still the case today, dialysate concentrations and hence extracellular concentrations of neurotransmitters have been interpreted as a direct index of the neuronal release of these specific neurotransmitter systems. Although this seems to be the case for neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin and acetylcholine, the extracellular concentrations of glutamate and {GABA} do not provide a reliable index of their synaptic exocytotic release. However, many microdialysis studies show changes in extracellular concentrations of glutamate and {GABA} under specific pharmacological and behavioural stimuli that could be interpreted as a consequence of the activation of specific neurochemical circuits. Despite this, we still do not know the origin and physiological significance of these changes of glutamate and {GABA} in the extracellular space. Here we propose that the changes in dialysate concentrations of these two neurotransmitters found under specific treatments could be an expression of the activity of the neurone-astrocyte unit in specific circuits of the brain. It is further proposed that dialysate changes of glutamate and {GABA} could be used as an index of volume transmission mediated actions of these two neurotransmitters in the brain. This hypothesis is based firstly on the assumption that the activity of neurones is functionally linked to the activity of astrocytes, which can release glutamate and {GABA} to the extracellular space; secondly, on the existence of extrasynaptic glutamate and {GABA} receptors with functional properties different from those of {GABA} receptors located at the synapse; and thirdly, on the experimental evidence reporting specific electrophysiological and neurochemical effects of glutamate and {GABA} when their levels are increased in the extracellular space. According to this concept, glutamate and {GABA}, once released into the extracellular compartment, could diffuse and have long-lasting effects modulating glutamatergic and/or {GABAergic} neurone-astrocytic networks and their interactions with other neurotransmitter neurone networks in the same areas of the brain.},

In this study, we investigated the properties of {AMPA} receptor-mediated synaptic currents in medial septal neurons of the rat in an in vitro slice preparation. Immunocytochemistry with a selective antibody to the {GluR}2 subunit revealed that both choline acetyltransferase-containing and parvalbumin-containing neurons of the medial septum express no detectable {GluR}2 subunit immunoreactivity. We used whole cell voltage-clamp recordings to measure synaptically evoked {AMPA} receptor-mediated currents from medial septal neurons following stimulation of midline afferents. The {GYKI} 52466 (50 {microM})- and 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide ({NBQX}) (20 {microM})-sensitive {AMPA} receptor-mediated component of the synaptic response was isolated by blocking {GABA}(A)- and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated currents with 30 {microM} bicuculline and 100 {microM} 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid, respectively. In some cases, patched cells were filled with Lucifer yellow (0.1\%) and imaged using 2-photon laser scanning microscopy. {AMPA} receptor-mediated currents that were observed in large medial septal neurons (20--30 microm) displayed rectification. These currents were sensitive to external application of philanthotoxin-343 ({PhTx}-343, 50 {microM}), a potent, high-affinity antagonist of Ca(2+)-permeable, {GluR}2-lacking {AMPA} receptors. Rectifying {AMPA} receptor-mediated currents also displayed a rapid increase in amplitude when evoked five times at low frequency such as 6 Hz. In contrast to currents observed in large medial septal neurons, {AMPA}-receptor mediated currents evoked in the remaining small (8--11 microm) neurons were nonrectifying and displayed rapid synaptic depression when stimulated five times at 6 Hz. The currents evoked in these cells were unaffected by external application of {PhTx}-343 and were therefore {GluR}2-containing {AMPA} receptors. The results of the present study demonstrate that the principal projection neurons of the medial septum contain {PhTx}-343-sensitive, {GluR}2-lacking {AMPA} receptors that display rapid current facilitation when stimulated at low frequencies.},

Here, we assessed the influence of ketone body, β-hydroxybutyrate ({BHB}) on the brain synthesis of kynurenic acid ({KYNA}), an endogenous antagonist of glutamatergic and α7-nicotinic receptors. In brain cortical slices and in primary glial cultures, {BHB} enhanced {KYNA} production. {KT} 5270, an inhibitor of protein kinase A, has prevented this action. At hypoglycemia, under {pH} 7.0 and 7.4, profound (15 {mM} {BHB}), but not mild (3 {mM}) ketosis increased synthesis of {KYNA}. In paradigm resembling diabetic ketoacidosis in vitro (30 {mM} glucose, {pH} 7.0), neither mild nor profound ketosis influenced the production of {KYNA}. At {pH} 7.4 and in 30 {mM} glucose though, both mild and severe ketonemia evoked an increase of {KYNA} production. The activity of {KYNA} biosynthetic enzymes, {KAT} I and {KAT} {II}, in cortical homogenate was not altered by {BHB} (0.05-10.0 {mM}). However, in cultured glial cells exposed to {BHB} (10 {mM}), the activity of {KATs} increased. This effect was reversed by the co-incubation of cells with {KT} 5270. Presented data reveal a novel mechanism of action of {BHB}. Increased synthesis of {KYNA} in the presence of {BHB} is most probably mediated by protein kinase A-dependent stimulation of {KATs} expression/activity leading to an increase of {KYNA} formation. Ensuing attenuation of the excessive excitatory glutamate-mediated neurotransmission may, at least in part, explain the neuroprotective actions of {BHB}.},

	abstract = {N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors ({NMDARs}) are ion channels gated by glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system ({CNS}). They are widespread in the {CNS} and are involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes including synaptic plasticity, chronic pain and psychosis. Aberrant {NMDAR} activity also plays an important role in the neuronal loss associated with ischaemic insults and major degenerative disorders including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Agents that target and alter {NMDAR} function may, thus, have therapeutic benefit. Interestingly, {NMDARs} are endowed with multiple extracellular regulatory sites that recognize ions or small molecule ligands, some of which are likely to regulate receptor function in vivo. These allosteric sites, which differ from agonist-binding and channel-permeation sites, provide means to modulate, either positively or negatively, {NMDAR} activity. The present review focuses on allosteric modulation of {NMDARs} containing the {NR}2B subunit. Indeed, the {NR}2B subunit confers a particularly rich pharmacology with distinct recognition sites for exogenous and endogenous allosteric ligands. Moreover, {NR}2B-containing receptors, compared with other {NMDAR} subtypes, appear to contribute preferentially to pathological processes linked to overexcitation of glutamatergic pathways.

Four of 16 enantiomers showed potentiating effects on basal synaptic transmission in anesthetized animals. By comparing one pair of enantiomers, (-)-clausenamide and (+)-clausenamide, we can report three primary findings: (1) (-)-clausenamide potentiated synaptic transmission in both anesthetized and freely moving animals while (+)-clausenamide showed no or little effect; (2) (-)-clausenamide increased the magnitude of long-term potentiation ({LTP}) induced by high-frequency stimulation ({HFS}) in anesthetized animals whereas (+)-clausenamide had no effect; (3) voltage-dependent calcium channels ({VDCCs}) calcineurin and calpain are involved in (-)-clausenamide-induced potentiation of synaptic transmission. Because hippocampal {LTP} is thought to reflect a cellular mechanism involved in learning and memory, our findings may provide the pharmacological basis for understanding the nootropic mechanisms of (-)-clausenamide, which is the first chiral nootropic agent developed in China.},

The resting membrane potential (E(m)) and reversal potential of {GABA}-induced anionic currents (E({GABA})) are among the most fundamental parameters controlling neuronal excitability. However, alterations of E(m) and E({GABA}) under conditions of metabolic stress are not sufficiently documented, although it is well known that metabolic crisis may lead to neuronal hyper-excitability and aberrant neuronal network activities. In this work, we show that in slices, availability of energy substrates determines whether {GABA} signaling displays an inhibitory or excitatory mode, both in neonatal neocortex and hippocampus. We demonstrate that in the neonatal brain, E(m) and E({GABA}) strongly depend on composition of the energy substrate pool. Complementing glucose with ketone bodies, pyruvate or lactate resulted in a significant hyperpolarization of both E(m) and E({GABA}), and induced a radical shift in the mode of {GABAergic} synaptic transmission towards network inhibition. Generation of giant depolarizing potentials, currently regarded as the hallmark of spontaneous neonatal network activity in vitro, was strongly inhibited both in neocortex and hippocampus in the energy substrate enriched solution. Based on these results we suggest the composition of the artificial cerebrospinal fluid, which bears a closer resemblance to the in vivo energy substrate pool. Our results suggest that energy deficits induce unfavorable changes in E(m) and E({GABA}), leading to neuronal hyperactivity that may initiate a cascade of pathological events.},

	abstract = {Microelectrode recording arrays of 60-100 electrodes are commonly used to record neuronal biopotentials, and these have aided our understanding of brain function, development and pathology. However, higher density microelectrode recording arrays of larger area are needed to study neuronal function over broader brain regions such as in cerebral cortex or hippocampal slices. Here, we present a novel design of a high electrode count picocurrent imaging array ({PIA}), based on an 81,920 pixel Indigo {ISC}9809 readout integrated circuit camera chip. While originally developed for interfacing to infrared photodetector arrays, we have adapted the chip for neuron recording by bonding it to microwire glass resulting in an array with an inter-electrode pixel spacing of 30 μm. In a high density electrode array, the ability to selectively record neural regions at high speed and with good signal to noise ratio are both functionally important. A critical feature of our {PIA} is that each pixel contains a dedicated low noise transimpedance amplifier (∼0.32 {pA} rms) which allows recording high signal to noise ratio biocurrents comparable to single electrode voltage amplifier recordings. Using selective sampling of 256 pixel subarray regions, we recorded the extracellular biocurrents of rabbit retinal ganglion cell spikes at sampling rates up to 7.2 {kHz}. Full array local electroretinogram currents could also be recorded at frame rates up to 100 Hz. A {PIA} with a full complement of 4 readout circuits would span 1cm and could acquire simultaneous data from selected regions of 1024 electrodes at sampling rates up to 9.3 {kHz}.},

Normal erythrocytes proved to be very resistant to oxidative damages, so the high concentration of H2O2 (10 {mM}) as well as the presence of natrium azide, a catalase inhibitor, was necessary. The levels of malonyldialdehyde ({MDA}), reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) and hemoglobin (Hb) released were evaluated as the measure of red cell peroxidative hemolysis. Pyruvate, at the lowest used concentration (0.3 {mM}), caused the inhibition of lipid peroxidation ({MDA}) and a drop in the level of {ROS}, as well as a diminution of the degree of hemolysis and the effects were stronger than those of other alpha-keto acids. At the highest (2 {mM}) concentration, the protective effect against oxidative damage of all the investigated alpha-keto acids was similar and amounted to nearly 50\% in relation to the control sample. On the contrary, in the case of aldehyde acid, e.g. glyoxylic acid, no protective effect in the same range of concentrations was found.

	abstract = {During development different energy substrates are available to cells in brain in plentiful supply. The metabolic environment, which is dictated by the milk diet rich in fat, ensures that substrates in addition to glucose are available as fuels. Some substrates serve readily as primary fuels for respiration, whereas other substrates can serve other functions in addition to serving as primary fuels. Primary fuels for respiration serve to supply acetyl {CoA} directly and as a result always have first priority. With this criteria in mind, a consideration of substrate priority for respiration by developing brain is presented. Many studies in the decade, 1970-1980, in human infants and in the rat pup model show that both glucose and the ketone bodies, acetoacetate and D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyrate, are taken up by brain and used for energy production and as carbon sources for lipogenesis. Products of fat metabolism, free fatty acids, ketone bodies, and glycerol dominate metabolic pools in early development as a consequence of the milk diet. This recognition of a distinctive metabolic environment from the well-fed adult was taken into consideration within the last decade when methods became available to obtain and study each of the major cell populations, neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in near homogeneous state in primary cultures. Studies on these cells made it possible to examine the distinctive metabolic properties and capabilities of each cell population to oxidize the metabolites that are available in development. Studies by many investigators on these cell populations show that all three can use glucose and the ketone bodies in respiration and for lipogenesis. Only one cell type, the astrocytes, can beta-oxidize fatty acids such as octanoate. By comparing the production of labeled carbon dioxide from glucose labeled on carbon-1 compared with carbon-6, it is clear that all three cell populations are capable of active hexose monophosphate shunt activity. Neurons and oligodendrocytes are capable of making good use of acetoacetate and D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyrate, whereas the best substrate for astrocytes is fatty acid. Under comparable conditions of incubation with astrocytes, fatty acids serve better than ketones, which in turn serve better than glucose in respiration. Some of the major factors that can explain the differing observations by different investigators on the capacity for substrate oxidation are presented. Over the last decade, astrocytes have captured the attention of neurobiologists because they have special attributes as metabolic support cells for the management of intermediary metabolism in brain.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

Some researches have shown that pharmacological manipulations in dopaminergic, serotonergic, and noradrenergic systems alter the occurrence of pilocarpine-induced {SE}. The control group was treated with 0.9\% saline (control group, s.c.). Another group of rats received pilocarpine (400mg/kg, s.c.) and both groups were sacrificed 24 h after the treatment. This work was performed to determine the alterations in monoamine levels (dopamine ({DA}), serotonin (5-{HT}) and norepinephrine ({NE})) and their metabolites (3,4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid ({DOPAC}), homovanilic acid ({HVA}), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-{HIAA})) after pilocarpine-induced {SE} in hippocampus and frontal cortex of adult rats. The monoamines and their metabolites were determined by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. {DA} and 5-{HIAA} concentrations were not altered in the hippocampus of the pilocarpine group, but in the same group the 5-{HT} (160\%), {DOPAC} (316\%) and {HVA} (21\%) levels increased, whereas, the {NE} (47\%) content declined. For the frontal cortex determinations, there was an increase of 20 and 72\% in {DA} and {DOPAC} levels, respectively, and a decrease in {NE} (32\%), 5-{HT} (33\%) and 5-{HIAA} (19\%) concentrations, but {HVA} content remained unaltered. These results indicate that pilocarpine-induced {SE} can alter monoamine levels in different ways depending on the brain area studied, suggesting that different mechanisms are involved.},

We here studied whether anticonvulsant compounds are antidepressant and can elevate hippocampal dopamine ({DA}) or serotonin (5-{HT}) levels determined by in vivo microdialysis in rats. We used assessment of seizure severity in the focal pilocarpine model, antidepressant-like activity within the rat forced swim and the mouse tail suspension tests, and locomotor activity in an open field as behavioural tests. We studied the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine, the selective 5-{HT} reuptake inhibitor citalopram and the selective {DA} reuptake blocker {GBR}-12909. These compounds with combined antidepressant-anticonvulsant properties all directly enhanced extracellular hippocampal {DA} or 5-{HT} levels. Since glutamate-mediated hyperexcitability in temporal lobe regions seems to be involved in disturbed emotional behaviour, we next investigated possible antidepressant effects and hippocampal {DA} or 5-{HT} modulations exerted by selective ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptor ligands with anticonvulsant properties. Combined anticonvulsant-antidepressant activities of the {NMDA} antagonist {MK}-801 and the {mGluR} group I antagonists ({AIDA}, {MPEP}) were also associated with locally elicited increases in hippocampal {DA} and/or 5-{HT} levels.

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}

Our recent work (Clinckers et al., J Neurochem 2004;89:834-43) demonstrated that intrahippocampal perfusion of 2 {nM} dopamine or serotonin via a microdialysis probe offered complete protection against focal pilocarpine-induced limbic seizures and did not influence basal extracellular hippocampal glutamate levels. Ten nanomolar dopamine or serotonin perfusion, however, worsened seizures and was accompanied by significant extracellular glutamate increases to approximately 200\%. The significance of these glutamate elevations in seizure generation remains unclear. The present microdialysis study investigated the modulatory role of extracellular hippocampal glutamate levels in these monoaminergic protective and proconvulsant effects.


{METHODS}

A first group of male Wistar albino rats was perfused intrahippocampally for 240 min with 6.25 {microM} glutamate alone to increase extracellular levels by 200\%. Other animals were perfused with anticonvulsant concentrations of monoamines throughout the experiments while receiving continuous coperfusions of 6.25 {microM} glutamate either before, during, and after (240 min) or only after (100 min) pilocarpine perfusion (40 min). Rats were scored for epileptic behavior, and the mean scores were compared with those of the control group. Microdialysates were analyzed for monoamine and glutamate content with microbore liquid chromatography.


{RESULTS}

No convulsions occurred during glutamate perfusion alone. When monoamines and glutamate were coperfused before pilocarpine administration, the anticonvulsant effect of the monoamines was lost. Glutamate addition after pilocarpine administration did not affect monoaminergic seizure protection.


{CONCLUSIONS}

These results indicate that extracellular glutamate increases per se do not necessarily induce seizures but that they can modulate the anticonvulsant effects exerted by hippocampal monoamines.},

Here we have investigated the effects of the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) in the rat kindling model of temporal lobe epilepsy. We show that 2DG potently reduces the progression of kindling and blocks seizure-induced increases in the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and its receptor, {TrkB}. This reduced expression is mediated by the transcription factor {NRSF}, which recruits the {NADH}-binding co-repressor {CtBP} to generate a repressive chromatin environment around the {BDNF} promoter. Our results show that 2DG has anticonvulsant and antiepileptic properties, suggesting that anti-glycolytic compounds may represent a new class of drugs for treating epilepsy.

Our objective was to determine in the adult rats the correlation between seizure susceptibility and extracellular glucose concentration in two models of seizures. Male rats were injected with two doses of streptozocin (40 mg/kg {IP}) on 2 consecutive days to induce diabetic hyperglycemia. Controls either received vehicle or were not injected. After 2 weeks, blood glucose concentration was measured, and the rats were subjected to flurothyl seizure test. Another group of rats received glucose solution (20\%, 5 ml {IP}) 30 minutes before testing to induce nondiabetic hyperglycemia. Thresholds for flurothyl-induced clonic and tonic-clonic seizures were determined. Finally, in vitro epileptiform activity was induced in the entorhinal cortex-hippocampal slices from naive rats by perfusing with magnesium-free medium with various glucose concentrations. In additional slices, paired-pulse paradigm was determined in the perforant path. Susceptibility to clonic and tonic-clonic flurothyl-induced seizures positively correlated with blood glucose concentrations as the increased glucose concentration was associated with proconvulsant effects. Similarly, in the in vitro experiments, epileptiform activity was promoted by increased and suppressed by decreased glucose concentrations. Data indicate that, in the adult rats, high glucose concentrations are associated with proconvulsant effects.},

	abstract = {The influence of pentylenetetrazol ({PTZ})-induced kindling of seizures on the rat emotional behavior, the brain monoamine turnover rate measured in vitro, and correlation between behavioral and biochemical parameters, were examined in rats. The repeated administration of {PTZ} (35 mg/kg, ip) evoked kindled seizures in rats (Stage 4 or 5 of clonic-tonic convulsions-maximum). {PTZ} kindling caused selective changes in the rat emotional behavior, present in some models of anxiety only (a decreased freezing time in the conditioned freezing test and a decreased spontaneous and aversively conditioned ultrasonic vocalization). Simultaneously, {PTZ} kindling decreased the concentration of homovanillic acid ({HVA}) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-{HIAA}) in the prefrontal cortex, decreased the {DA} ({HVA}/{DA} ratio) turnover rate in the striatum, and inhibited the serotonin (5-{HT}) metabolism (5-{HIAA}/5-{HT} ratio) in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. Correlations between dopamine ({DA}) or 5-{HT} regional metabolic rates in brain structures and animal behavior were either abolished or reversed in {PTZ}-kindled animals. It is concluded that both {DA} and 5-{HT} systems contribute to the emotional effects of {PTZ}-induced kindling of seizures. The hypothesis is put forward that {PTZ} kindling-induced inhibition of the serotonergic innervation may lead to the compensatory increase in 5-{HT}(1A) receptors in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, thus evoking the anxiolytic-like changes in animal behavior.},

The large amounts of {ROS} are kept in check by an elaborate network of antioxidants, which sometimes fail and lead to neuronal oxidative stress. Thus, {ROS} are typically categorized as neurotoxic molecules and typically exert their detrimental effects via oxidation of essential macromolecules such as enzymes and cytoskeletal proteins. Most importantly, excessive {ROS} are associated with decreased performance in cognitive function. However, at physiological concentrations, {ROS} are involved in functional changes necessary for synaptic plasticity and hence, for normal cognitive function. The fine line of role reversal of {ROS} from good molecules to bad molecules is far from being fully understood. This review focuses on identifying the multiple sources of {ROS} in the mammalian nervous system and on presenting evidence for the critical and essential role of {ROS} in synaptic plasticity and memory. The review also shows that the inability to restrain either age- or pathology-related increases in {ROS} levels leads to opposite, detrimental effects that are involved in impairments in synaptic plasticity and memory function.},

To examine energetic costs of arousing from hibernation under arctic compared to temperate conditions, captive ground squirrels were maintained in ambient temperatures (T(a)) of 2, -5 and -12 degrees C. Rates of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production were used to estimate metabolic rate and fuel use during the three phases of arousal episodes: rewarming, euthermia, and recooling. Respiratory quotient comparisons suggest exclusive use of lipid during rewarming and mixed fuel use during euthermia. Animals rewarming from torpor at T(a) -12 degrees C took longer, consumed more oxygen, and attained higher peak rates of oxygen consumption when compared to 2 degrees C. T(a) had no significant effect on cost or duration of the euthermic phase. Animals recooled faster at -12 degrees C than at 2 degrees C, but total oxygen consumption was not different. T(a) had no significant effect on the total cost of arousal episodes when all three phases are included. Arousal episodes account for 86\% of estimated costs of a complete hibernation cycle including torpor when at 2 degrees C and only 23\% at -12 degrees C. Thus, due to the higher costs of steady-state metabolism during torpor, proportional metabolic costs of arousal episodes at T(a) characteristic of the Arctic are diminished compared to relative costs of arousals in more temperate conditions.},

The ability to hibernate is found throughout the class Mammalia and appears to involve differential expression of genes common to all mammals, rather than the induction of novel gene products unique to the hibernating state. The hibernation season is characterized by extended bouts of torpor, during which minimal body temperature (Tb) can fall as low as -2.9 degrees C and metabolism can be reduced to 1\% of euthermic rates. Many global biochemical and physiological processes exploit low temperatures to lower reaction rates but retain the ability to resume full activity upon rewarming. Other critical functions must continue at physiologically relevant levels during torpor and be precisely regulated even at Tb values near 0 degrees C. Research using new tools of molecular and cellular biology is beginning to reveal how hibernators survive repeated cycles of torpor and arousal during the hibernation season. Comprehensive approaches that exploit advances in genomic and proteomic technologies are needed to further define the differentially expressed genes that distinguish the summer euthermic from winter hibernating states. Detailed understanding of hibernation from the molecular to organismal levels should enable the translation of this information to the development of a variety of hypothermic and hypometabolic strategies to improve outcomes for human and animal health.},

	abstract = {Torpor during hibernation defines the nadir of mammalian metabolism where whole animal rates of metabolism are decreased to as low as 2\% of basal metabolic rate. This capacity to decrease profoundly the metabolic demand of organs and tissues has the potential to translate into novel therapies for the treatment of ischemia associated with stroke, cardiac arrest or trauma where delivery of oxygen and nutrients fails to meet demand. If metabolic demand could be arrested in a regulated way, cell and tissue injury could be attenuated. Metabolic suppression achieved during hibernation is regulated, in part, by the central nervous system through indirect and possibly direct means. In this study, we review recent evidence for mechanisms of central nervous system control of torpor in hibernating rodents including evidence of a permissive, hibernation protein complex, a role for A1 adenosine receptors, mu opiate receptors, glutamate and thyrotropin-releasing hormone. Central sites for regulation of torpor include the hippocampus, hypothalamus and nuclei of the autonomic nervous system. In addition, we discuss evidence that hibernation phenotypes can be translated to non-hibernating species by H(2)S and 3-iodothyronamine with the caveat that the hypothermia, bradycardia, and metabolic suppression induced by these compounds may or may not be identical to mechanisms employed in true hibernation.},

	abstract = {Seizures are the result of a sudden and temporary synchronization of neuronal activity, the reason for which is not clearly understood. Astrocytes participate in the control of neurotransmitter storage and neurotransmission efficacy. They provide fuel to neurons, which need a high level of energy to sustain normal and pathological neuronal activities, such as during epilepsy. Various genetic or induced animal models have been developed and used to study epileptogenic mechanisms. Methionine sulfoximine induces both seizures and the accumulation of brain glycogen, which might be considered as a putative energy store to neurons in various animals. Animals subjected to methionine sulfoximine develop seizures similar to the most striking form of human epilepsy, with a long pre-convulsive period of several hours, a long convulsive period during up to 48 hours and a post convulsive period during which they recover normal behavior. The accumulation of brain glycogen has been demonstrated in both the cortex and cerebellum as early as the pre-convulsive period, indicating that this accumulation is not a consequence of seizures. The accumulation results from an activation of gluconeogenesis specifically localized to astrocytes, both in vivo and in vitro. Both seizures and brain glycogen accumulation vary when using different inbred strains of mice. C57BL/6J is the most "resistant" strain to methionine sulfoximine, while {CBA}/J is the most "sensitive" one. The present review describes the data obtained on methionine sulfoximine dependent seizures and brain glycogen in the light of neurotransmission, highlighting the relevance of brain glycogen content in epilepsies.},

It has been shown that {ROS} production accompanies cytochrome c release in different apoptotic paradigms, but the site(s) of {ROS} production remain obscure. In the current study, we demonstrate that loss of cytochrome c by mitochondria oxidizing {NAD}(+)-linked substrates results in a dramatic increase of {ROS} production and respiratory inhibition. This increased {ROS} production can be mimicked by rotenone, a complex I inhibitor, as well as other chemical inhibitors of electron flow that act further downstream in the electron transport chain. The effects of cytochrome c depletion from mitoplasts on {ROS} production and respiration are reversible upon addition of exogenous cytochrome c. Thus in these models of mitochondrial injury, a primary site of {ROS} generation in both brain and heart mitochondria is proximal to the rotenone inhibitory site, rather than in complex {III}. {ROS} production at complex I is critically dependent upon a highly reduced state of the mitochondrial {NAD}(P)(+) pool and is achieved upon nearly complete inhibition of the respiratory chain. Redox clamp experiments using the acetoacetate/L-beta-hydroxybutyrate couple in the presence of a maximally inhibitory rotenone concentration suggest that the site is approx. 50 {mV} more electronegative than the {NADH}/{NAD}(+) couple. In the absence of inhibitors, this highly reduced state of mitochondria can be induced by reverse electron flow from succinate to {NAD}(+), accounting for profound {ROS} production in the presence of succinate. These results lead us to propose a model of thermodynamic control of mitochondrial {ROS} production which suggests that the {ROS}-generating site of complex I is the Fe-S centre N-1a.},

The reducing agents dithiothreitol (2 {mM}) and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (1 {mM}) potentiated {GABA}-evoked Cl(-) currents recorded by two-electrode voltage-clamp, while the oxidants 5-5'-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (500 {microM}) and oxidized dithiothreitol (2 {mM}) caused inhibition.

All the effects were rapid and easily reversible. Redox modulation of {GABArho}(1) receptors was strongly dependent on the {GABA} concentration; dose-response curves for {GABA} were shifted to the left in the presence of reducing agents, whereas oxidizing agents produced the opposite effect, without changes in the maximal response to {GABA} and in the Hill coefficient.

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}

Heat shock protein-27 ({HSP}-27) belongs to the group of small heat shock proteins that become induced in response to various pathologic conditions. {HSP}-27 has been shown to protect cells and subcellular structures, particularly mitochondria, and serves as a carrier for estradiol. It is a reliable marker for tissues affected by oxidative stress. Oxidative stress and related cellular defence mechanisms are currently thought to play a major role during experimentally induced epileptic neuropathology. We addressed the question whether {HSP}-27 becomes induced in the neocortex resected from patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy.


{METHODS}

Human epileptic temporal neocortex was obtained during neurosurgery, and control tissue was obtained at autopsy from subjects without known neurologic diseases. The tissues were either frozen for Western blot analysis or fixed in Zamboni's fixative for the topographic detection of {HSP}-27 at the cellular level by means of immunohistochemistry.


{RESULTS}

{HSP}-27 was highly expressed in all epilepsy specimens and in the cortex of a patient who died in the final stage of multiple sclerosis (positive control), whereas only low amounts of {HSP}-27 were detectable in control brains. In epilepsy patients, {HSP}-27 was present in astrocytes and in the walls of blood vessels. The intracortical distribution patterns varied strongly among the epilepsy specimens.


{CONCLUSIONS}

These results demonstrate that {HSP}-27 becomes induced in response to epileptic pathology. Although the functional aspects of {HSP}-27 induction during human epilepsy have yet to be elucidated, it can be concluded that {HSP}-27 is a marker for cortical regions in which a stress response has been caused by seizures.},

	abstract = {The mammalian hippocampus, together with subcortical and cortical areas, is responsible for some forms of learning and memory. Proper hippocampal function depends on the highly dynamic nature of its circuitry, including the ability of synapses to change their strength for brief to long periods of time. In this study, we focused on a transient depression of glutamatergic synaptic transmission at Schaffer collateral synapses in acute hippocampal slices. The depression of evoked excitatory postsynaptic current ({EPSC}) amplitudes, herein called transient depression, follows brief trains of synaptic stimulation in stratum radiatum of {CA}1 and lasts for 2-3 min. Depression results from a decrease in presynaptic glutamate release, as {NMDA}-receptor-mediated {EPSCs} and composite {EPSCs} are depressed similarly and depression is accompanied by an increase in the paired-pulse ratio. Transient depression is prevented by blockade of metabotropic glutamate and acetylcholine receptors, presumably located presynaptically. These two receptor types--acting together--cause depression. Blockade of a single receptor type necessitates significantly stronger conditioning trains for triggering depression. Addition of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor enables depression from previously insufficient conditioning trains. Furthermore, a strong coincident, but not causal, relationship existed between presynaptic depression and postsynaptic internal Ca(2+) release, emphasizing the potential importance of functional interactions between presynaptic and postsynaptic effects of convergent cholinergic and glutamatergic inputs to {CA}1. These convergent afferents, one intrinsic to the hippocampus and the other likely originating in the medial septum, may regulate {CA}1 network activity, the induction of long-term synaptic plasticity, and ultimately hippocampal function.},

	abstract = {Metabotropic glutamate receptors ({mGluRs}) are involved in many forms of neuronal plasticity. In the hippocampus, they have well-defined roles in long-lasting forms of both synaptic and intrinsic plasticity. Here, we describe a novel form of long-lasting intrinsic plasticity that we call (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine ({DHPG})-mediated long-term depression of excitability ({DHPG}-{LDE}), and which is generated following transient pharmacological activation of group I {mGluRs}. In extracellular recordings from hippocampal slices, {DHPG}-{LDE} was expressed as a long-lasting depression of antidromic compound action potentials ({cAPs}) in {CA}1 or {CA}3 cells following a 4-min exposure to the group I {mGluR} agonist (S)-{DHPG}. A similar phenomenon was also seen for orthodromic fibre volleys evoked in {CA}3 axons. In single-cell recordings from {CA}1 pyramids, {DHPG}-{LDE} was manifest as persistent failures in antidromic action potential generation. {DHPG}-{LDE} was blocked by (S)-(+)-a-amino-4-carboxy-2-methylbenzeneacetic acid ({LY}367385), an antagonist of {mGluR}1, but not 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine hydrochloride ({MPEP}), an {mGluR}5 inhibitor. Although insensitive to antagonists of alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate/kainate and gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) receptors, {DHPG}-{LDE} was blocked by antagonists of N-methyl-D-aspartate ({NMDA}) receptors. Similarly, in single-cell recordings, {DHPG}-mediated antidromic spike failures were eliminated by {NMDA} receptor antagonism. Long after (S)-{DHPG} washout, {DHPG}-{LDE} was reversed by {mGluR}1 antagonism. A 4-min application of (S)-{DHPG} also produced an {NMDA} receptor-dependent persistent depolarization of {CA}1 pyramidal cells. This depolarization was not solely responsible for {DHPG}-{LDE}, because a similar level of depolarization elicited by raising extracellular K(+) increased the amplitude of the {cAP}. {DHPG}-{LDE} did not involve {HCN} channels or protein synthesis, but was eliminated by blockers of protein kinase C or tyrosine phosphatases.},

We investigated the role of metabotropic glutamate-8 receptor ({mGluR}8) gene expression in cerebellum during epilepsy and neuroprotective role of Bacopa monnieri extract in epilepsy. We also studied the effect of {NMDA} receptor 1 ({NMDAR}1) gene expression during neonatal hypoxia and therapeutic role of glucose, oxygen and epinephrine supplementation. During epilepsy a significant down-regulation (P {\textless} 0.01) of {mGluR}8 gene expression was observed which was up-regulated (P {\textless} 0.05) near control level after B. monnieri treatment which is supported by Morris water maze experiment. In hypoxic neonates we observed up-regulation (P {\textless} 0.001) of the {NMDAR}1 gene expression whereas glucose and glucose + oxygen was able to significantly reverse (P {\textless} 0.001) the gene expression to near control level when compared to hypoxia and epinephrine treatment which was supported by open field test. Our results showed that B. monnieri treatment to epileptic rats significantly brought the reversal of the down-regulated {mgluR}8 gene expression toward control level. In neonatal rats, hypoxia induced expressional and functional changes in the {NMDAR}1 receptors of neuronal cells which is corrected by supplementation of glucose alone or glucose followed by oxygen during the resuscitation to prevent the glutamate related neuronal damage. Thus, the results suggest the clinical significance of corrective measures for epileptic and hypoxic management.},

By the present in vivo system, L-glutamate was selectively assayed with about a 600-fold increase in sensitivity compared with the unamplified responses. The detection limit was 0.08 mumol dm-3.

	abstract = {Rats organize their open field behavior into a series of exploratory trips focused around a central location or home base. In addition, differences in movement kinematics have been used to fractionate the exploratory trip into tour (i.e., sequences of linear movement or progressions punctuated by stops) and homeward (i.e., single progression direct to the home base) segments. The observation of these characteristics independent of environmental familiarity and visual cue availability has suggested a role for self-movement information or dead reckoning in organizing exploratory behavior. Although previous work has implicated a role for the septohippocampal system in dead reckoning based navigation, as of yet, no studies have investigated the contribution of the medial septum to dead reckoning. First, the present study examined the organization of exploratory behavior under dark and light conditions in control rats and rats receiving either electrolytic or sham medial septum lesions. Medial septum lesions produced a significant increase in homeward segment path circuity and variability of temporal pacing of linear speeds. Second, as an independent assessment of the effectiveness of the medial septum lesions, rats were trained to locate a hidden platform in the standard water maze procedure. Consistent with previous research, medial septum lesions attenuated learning the location of the hidden platform. These results demonstrate a role for the medial septum in organizing exploratory behavior and provide further support for the role of the septohippocampal system in dead reckoning based navigation.},

	abstract = {A consistent finding in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease is a loss of the cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain that project to the hippocampus. However, the role this depletion plays in the development of Alzheimer's disease remains unclear. The loss of this ascending neurotransmitter system could potentially render hippocampal neurons more susceptible to further insult, such as chronic stress, ultimately resulting in neuronal death and memory loss. We explored this possibility by using the highly specific toxin 192 {IgG}-Saporin to destroy the majority of cholinergic activity in the septo-hippocampal pathway in rats. Following depletion, rats were subjected to 2 weeks of restraint stress. Rats were divided into two groups and were tested either on a hippocampal-dependent (water maze) task or a hippocampal-independent task (fear conditioning to tone and context). We showed that cholinergic depletion or stress alone had no effect on the successful performance of either of the tasks. However, rats with a combination of cholinergic depletion and stress were significantly impaired on the water-maze task. No deficits were apparent in the combined group that was tested on fear conditioning to tone or context, suggesting that this impairment is specific to spatial working memory. These rats had no obvious hippocampal neuronal loss or damage; however, there were likely subtle changes in hippocampal processing that led to the observed deficit on the hippocampal-dependent task. These findings support our theory that cholinergic depletion of the medial septum increases hippocampal vulnerability to further insults such as stress.},

An impaired sensorimotor gating, measured by prepulse inhibition ({PPI}) of the acoustic startle response, was observed following a hippocampal afterdischarge ({AD}) or systemic injection of {PCP} and was accompanied with an increase in hippocampal gamma waves (30-70 Hz). The medial septum infusion with muscimol (0.25 microg), a {GABA}(A) receptor agonist, 15 min prior to {PCP} or a hippocampal {AD}, prevented the impairment of sensorimotor gating and the increase in gamma waves. By itself, muscimol (0.25 microg) injection into the medial septum did not affect {PPI}, although it significantly suppressed spontaneous gamma waves. In order to identify subpopulations of neurons mediating the sensorimotor gating deficit and the hippocampal gamma wave increase, 0.14-0.21 microg of p75 antibody conjugated to saporin (192 {IgG}-saporin) was injected into the medial septum to selectively lesion the septohippocampal cholinergic neurons. Neither the {PPI} deficit nor the gamma wave increase induced by {PCP} or a hippocampal {AD} was affected by 192 {IgG}-saporin lesion of the medial septum. It is concluded that increase in neural activity in the medial septum participates in the impairment of sensorimotor gating and the increase in hippocampal gamma waves induced by {PCP} or a hippocampal {AD}.

	abstract = {Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone ({CRH}) or Corticotropin-Releasing Factor ({CRF}) and its family of related naturally occurring endogenous peptides and receptors are becoming recognized for their actions within central ({CNS}) and peripheral ({PNS}) nervous systems. It should be recognized that the term '{CRH}' has been displaced by '{CRF}' [Guillemin, R., 2005. Hypothalamic hormones a.k.a. hypothalamic releasing factors. J. Endocrinol. 184, 11-28]. However, to maintain uniformity among contributions to this special issue we have used the original term, {CRH}. The term '{CRF}' has been associated recently with {CRH} receptors and designated with subscripts by the {IUPHAR} nomenclature committee [Hauger, R.L., Grigoriadis, D.E., Dallman, M.F., Plotsky, P.M., Vale, W.W., Dautzenberg, F.M., 2003. International Union of Pharmacology. {XXXVI}. Corticotrophin-releasing factor and their ligands. Pharmacol. Rev. 55, 21-26] to denote the type and subtype of receptors activated or antagonized by {CRH} ligands. {CRH}, as a hormone, has long been identified as the regulator of basal and stress-induced {ACTH} release within the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis ({HPA} axis). But the concept, that {CRH} and its related endogenous peptides and receptor ligands have non-{HPA} axis actions to regulate {CNS} synaptic transmission outside the {HPA} axis, is just beginning to be recognized and identified [Orozco-Cabal, L., Pollandt, S., Liu, J., Shinnick-Gallagher, P., Gallagher, J.P., 2006a. Regulation of Synaptic Transmission by {CRF} Receptors. Rev. Neurosci. 17, 279-307; Orozco-Cabal, L., Pollandt, S., Liu, J., Vergara, L., Shinnick-Gallagher, P., Gallagher, J.P., 2006b. A novel rat medial prefrontal cortical slice preparation to investigate synaptic transmission from amygdala to layer V prelimbic pyramidal neurons. J. Neurosci. Methods 151, 148-158] is especially noteworthy since this synapse has become a prime focus for a variety of mental diseases, e.g. schizophrenia [Fischbach, G.D., 2007. {NRG}1 and synaptic function in the {CNS}. Neuron 54, 497-497], and neurological disorders, e.g., Alzheimer's disease [Bell, K.F., Cuello, C.A., 2006. Altered synaptic function in Alzheimer's disease. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 545, 11-21]. We suggest that "The Stressed Synapse" has been overlooked [c.f., Kim, J.J., Diamond, D.M. 2002. The stressed hippocampus, synaptic plasticity and lost memories. Nat. Rev., Neurosci. 3, 453-462; Radley, J.J., Morrison, J.H., 2005. Repeated stress and structural plasticity in the brain. Ageing Res. Rev. 4, 271-287] as a major contributor to many {CNS} disorders. We present data demonstrating {CRH} neuroregulatory and neuromodulatory actions at three limbic synapses, the basolateral amygdala to central amygdala synapse; the basolateral amygdala to medial prefrontal cortex synapse, and the lateral septum mediolateral nucleus synapse. A novel stress circuit is presented involving these three synapses. We suggest that {CRH} ligands and their receptors are significant etiological factors that need to be considered in the pharmacotherapy of mental diseases associated with {CNS} synaptic transmission.},

	abstract = {Brain cholesterol synthesis inhibition ({CSI}) at a young age in rats has been shown to be a faithful model of acquired absence epilepsy, a devastating condition for which few therapies or models exist. We employed the {CSI} model to study cellular mechanisms of acquired absence epilepsy in Long-Evans Hooded rats. Patch-clamp, whole-cell recordings were compared from neurons acutely dissociated from the nucleus reticularis of thalamus ({nRt}) treated and untreated with a cholesterol synthesis inhibitor, U18666A. In U18666A-treated animals, 91\% of rats developed {EEG} spike-waves ({SWs}). Patchclamp results revealed that although there was no remarkable change in {GABAA} receptor affinity, both a loss of ability of benzodiazepines to enhance {GABAA}-receptor responses and an increase of Zn2+ inhibition of {GABAA}-receptor responses of {nRt} neurons occurred in Long-Evans Hooded rats previously administered U18666A. This change was specific, since no significant changes were found in neurons exposed to the {GABA} allosteric modulator, pentobarbital. Taken collectively, these findings provide evidence for abnormalities in benzodiazepine and Zn2+ modulation of {GABAA} receptors in the {CSI} model, and suggest that decreased gamma2 subunit expression may underlie important aspects of generation of thalamocortical {SWs} in atypical absence seizures. The present results are also consistent with recent findings that mutation of the gamma2 subunit of the {GABAA} receptor changes benzodiazepine modulation in families with generalized epilepsy syndromes.},

	abstract = {Brain cholesterol synthesis inhibition ({CSI}) at a young age in rats has been shown to be a faithful model of acquired absence epilepsy, a devastating condition for which few therapies or models exist. We employed the {CSI} model to study cellular mechanisms of acquired absence epilepsy in Long-Evans Hooded rats. Patch-clamp, whole-cell recordings were compared from neurons acutely dissociated from the nucleus reticularis of thalamus ({nRt}) treated and untreated with a cholesterol synthesis inhibitor, U18666A. In U18666A-treated animals, 91\% of rats developed {EEG} spike-waves ({SWs}). Patchclamp results revealed that although there was no remarkable change in {GABAA} receptor affinity, both a loss of ability of benzodiazepines to enhance {GABAA}-receptor responses and an increase of Zn2+ inhibition of {GABAA}-receptor responses of {nRt} neurons occurred in Long-Evans Hooded rats previously administered U18666A. This change was specific, since no significant changes were found in neurons exposed to the {GABA} allosteric modulator, pentobarbital. Taken collectively, these findings provide evidence for abnormalities in benzodiazepine and Zn2+ modulation of {GABAA} receptors in the {CSI} model, and suggest that decreased gamma2 subunit expression may underlie important aspects of generation of thalamocortical {SWs} in atypical absence seizures. The present results are also consistent with recent findings that mutation of the gamma2 subunit of the {GABAA} receptor changes benzodiazepine modulation in families with generalized epilepsy syndromes.},

The development of the subunits expression may be related to the age-dependency of epilepsy. Nevertheless, developmental and spatial changes in expression of {GABA}(A) receptors have not been examined in the human brain. Using immunohistochemistry, we examined the development of {GABARA}1 and {GABARG}2 in the human temporal lobe, hippocampus and basal ganglia in specimens obtained from 21 fetuses/subjects who died aged 22 gestation weeks ({GW}) to 75 years. Unique developmental changes of {GABARA}1 and {GABARG}2 were recorded in each region. In hippocampal pyramidal cells, {GABARA}1 was already found from 22 {GW} mainly on {CA}2-3, whereas {GABARG}2 was expressed later than {GABARA}1 predominantly in {CA}3. In the temporal cortex, both subunits appeared in the pyramidal cells layer from 22 {GW}, while {GABARA}1 and {GABARG}2 expression was increased from 29 to 38 {GW}, respectively. Furthermore, transient increase of {GABARA}1 was detected in the granular cell layer of the hippocampus from 29 {GW} to 4 months, in the cortical pyramidal cell layer from 29 to 40 {GW}, and in the putamen from birth to 5 years of age. Thus gradual or transient increase of {GABARA}1 and {GABARG}2 was found in every region at different age. These developmental changes in the expression of these subunits may contribute to the age dependency in some epilepsy syndromes where deficiency of {GABARA}1 and {GABARG}2 is involved.},

	abstract = {The hippocampal theta rhythm is generated by the pacemaker activity of the medial septum-diagonal band of Broca ({MS}/{DBB}) neurons. These nuclei are influenced by brainstem structures that modulate the theta rhythm. The aim of the present work is to determine whether the nucleus incertus ({NI}), which has important anatomical connections with the {MS}/{DBB}, contributes to the hippocampal theta rhythm generation in rats. Hippocampal field activity was recorded in urethane-anaesthetized rats. Electrical stimulation of the {NI} not only evoked theta rhythm in the hippocampus, but also decreased the amplitude of delta waves. Unit recordings in the {NI} revealed either a non-rhythm discharge pattern in most neurons (76\%), or a rhythm activity at 13-25 Hz in the remaining neurons. The firing rate of these neurons increased during the presence of theta rhythm evoked by either sensory or reticularis pontis oralis nucleus ({RPO}) stimulation. Electrolytic lesions of {NI}, or the microinjection of the gamma-aminobutyric acid ({GABA})A agonist muscimol, abolished the theta rhythm evoked by {RPO} stimulation. Consequently, the {NI} may be a relay station between brainstem structures and the {MS}/{DBB} in the control of the hippocampal theta rhythm generation.},

Power but not frequency of {NMDA}-induced theta was significantly greater than tail pinch-induced theta activity. This effect was antagonized by intrahippocampal infusion of {AP}5, but unaffected by i.v. atropine sulfate. During {AP}5 blockade tail pinch theta frequency and power were significantly reduced. Microinfusion of {NMDA} into the medial septum also resulted in long lasting induction of hippocampal theta field activity. Contrary to the results of hippocampal {NMDA} microinfusions, frequency but not power of {NMDA}-induced theta was significantly greater than tail pinch- induced theta activity. Microinfusion of {AP}5 into the medial septum significantly lowered power of tail pinch-induced theta but did not affect frequency. Wheel running behavior of rats induced by low levels of electrical stimulation of the posterior hypothalamic nucleus ({PH}) was completely abolished by microinfusion of {AP}5 into the medial septum, accompanied by a significant reduction in theta power and frequency. Wheel running and theta were maintained at control levels with high intensity {PH} stimulation. We propose that: (1) the glutamatergic septohippocampal projection represents a third pathway capable of generating hippocampal field and cellular synchrony, independent of that generated by the septohippocampal cholinergic and {GABAergic} projections, and (2) the septohippocampal glutamatergic projection serves to function as an interface between cholinergic and {GABAergic} modulated sensory processing Type 2 theta and movement related Type 1 theta.},

	abstract = {The proteins of the Bcl-2 family are important regulators of programmed cell death. Structural studies of Bcl-2 family members have provided many important insights into their molecular mechanism of action and how members of this family interact with one another. To date, structural studies have been performed on six Bcl-2 family members encompassing both anti- (Bcl-{xL}, Bcl-2, {KSHV}-Bcl-2, Bcl-w) and pro-apoptotic (Bax, Bid) members. They all show a remarkably similar fold despite an overall divergence in amino acid sequence and function (pro-apoptotic versus anti-apoptotic). The three-dimensional structures of Bcl-2 family members consist of two central, predominantly hydrophobic α-helices surrounded by six or seven amphipathic α-helices of varying lengths. A long, unstructured loop is present between the first two α-helices. The structures of the Bcl-2 proteins show a striking similarity to the overall fold of the pore-forming domains of bacterial toxins. This finding led to experiments which demonstrated that Bcl-{xL}, Bcl-2, and Bax all form pores in artificial membranes. A prominent hydrophobic groove is present on the surface of the anti-apoptotic proteins. This groove is the binding site for peptides that mimic the {BH}3 region of various pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bak and Bad. Structures of Bcl-{xL} in complex with these {BH}3 peptides showed that they bind as an amphipathic α-helix and make extensive hydrophobic contacts with the protein. These data have not only helped to elucidate the interactions important for hetero-dimerization of Bcl-2 family members but have also been used to guide the discovery of small molecules that block Bcl-{xL} and Bcl-2 function. In the recently determined structure of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-w protein, the protein was also found to have a hydrophobic groove on its surface capable of binding {BH}3-containing proteins and peptides. However, in the native protein an additional carboxy-terminal α-helix interacts with the hydrophobic groove. This is reminiscent of how the carboxy-terminal α-helix of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax binds into its hydrophobic groove. This interaction may play a regulatory role and for Bax may explain why it is found predominately in the cytoplasm prior to activation. The hydrophobic groove of the pro-apoptotic protein, Bid protein, is neither as long nor as deep as that found in Bcl-{xL}, Bcl-2, or Bax. In addition, Bid contains an extra α-helix, which is located between α1 and α2 with respect to Bcl-{xL}, Bcl-2, and Bax. Although there are still many unanswered questions regarding the exact mechanism by which the Bcl-2 family of proteins modulates apoptosis, structural studies of these proteins have deepened our understanding of apoptosis on the molecular level.},

	abstract = {Programmed cell death ({PCD}) is essential for normal development and maintenance of tissue homeostasis in multicellular organisms. While it is now evident that {PCD} can take many different forms, apoptosis is probably the most well-defined cell death programme. The characteristic morphological and biochemical features associated with this highly regulated form of cell death have until recently been exclusively attributed to the caspase family of cysteine proteases. As a result, many investigators affiliate apoptosis with its pivotal execution system, i.e. caspase activation. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that {PCD} or apoptosis can also proceed in a caspase-independent manner and maintain key characteristics of apoptosis. Mitochondrial integrity is central to both caspase-dependent and-independent cell death. The release of pro-apoptotic factors from the mitochondrial intermembrane space is a key event in a cell's commitment to die and is under the tight regulation of the Bcl-2 family. However, the underlying mechanisms governing the efflux of these pro-death molecules are largely unknown. This review will focus on the regulation of mitochondrial integrity by Bcl-2 family members with particular attention to the controlled release of factors involved in caspase-independent cell death.},

As complex alternative splicing processes in nerve cells generate a large number of {NX} and {NLs} variants, it has been proposed that a combinatorial interaction code generated by these variants may determine synapse identity and network connectivity during brain development. The functional importance of {NXs} and {NLs} is exemplified by the fact that mutations in {NX} and {NL} genes are associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders, most notably with autism. Accordingly, major research efforts have focused on the molecular mechanisms by which {NXs} and {NLs} operate at synapses. In this review, we summarize recent progress in this field and discuss emerging topics, such as the role of alternative interaction partners of {NXs} and {NLs} in synapse formation and function, and their relevance for synaptic plasticity in the mature brain. The novel findings highlight the fundamental importance of {NX}–{NL} interactions in a wide range of synaptic functions.},

Even after axons have navigated long distances to reach target areas, they must still choose appropriate synaptic partners from the many potential partners within easy reach. In many cases, axons also select a particular domain of the postsynaptic cell on which to form a synapse. Thus, synapse formation is selective at both cellular and subcellular levels. Unsurprisingly, the nervous system uses multiple mechanisms to ensure proper connectivity; these include complementary labels, coordinated growth of synaptic partners, sorting of afferents, prohibition or elimination of inappropriate synapses, respecification of targets, and use of short-range guidance mechanisms or intermediate targets. Specification of any circuit is likely to involve integration of multiple mechanisms. Recent studies of vertebrate and invertebrate systems have led to the identification of molecules that mediate a few of these interactions.},

Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization ({MOMP}) is also associated with fragmentation of the mitochondrial network. The mechanisms that lead to the oligomerization of proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family and to {MOMP} are still unclear and the role of mitochondrial fission in these events remains elusive.},

	abstract = {Irrespective of the morphological features of end-stage cell death (that may be apoptotic, necrotic, autophagic, or mitotic), mitochondrial membrane permeabilization ({MMP}) is frequently the decisive event that delimits the frontier between survival and death. Thus mitochondrial membranes constitute the battleground on which opposing signals combat to seal the cell's fate. Local players that determine the propensity to {MMP} include the pro- and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, proteins from the mitochondrialpermeability transition pore complex, as well as a plethora of interacting partners including mitochondrial lipids. Intermediate metabolites, redox processes, sphingolipids, ion gradients, transcription factors, as well as kinases and phosphatases link lethal and vital signals emanating from distinct subcellular compartments to mitochondria. Thus mitochondria integrate a variety of proapoptotic signals. Once {MMP} has been induced, it causes the release of catabolic hydrolases and activators of such enzymes (including those of caspases) from mitochondria. These catabolic enzymes as well as the cessation of the bioenergetic and redox functions of mitochondria finally lead to cell death, meaning that mitochondria coordinate the late stage of cellular demise. Pathological cell death induced by ischemia/reperfusion, intoxication with xenobiotics, neurodegenerative diseases, or viral infection also relies on {MMP} as a critical event. The inhibition of {MMP} constitutes an important strategy for the pharmaceutical prevention of unwarranted cell death. Conversely, induction of {MMP} in tumor cells constitutes the goal of anticancer chemotherapy.},

Although there is no disagreement that {BCL}-2 proteins regulate apoptosis, the mechanism leading to {MOMP} remains controversial.

Specifically, do the {BH}3-only proteins directly engage {BAX} and/or {BAK} activation or do these proteins solely promote apoptosis by neutralization of anti-apoptotic {BCL}-2 proteins?

	abstract = {Under conditions of mitochondrial calcium overload, especially when accompanied by oxidative stress, elevated phosphate concentrations and adenine nucleotide depletion, a non-specific pore, the mitochondrial permeability transition pore ({MPTP}), opens in the inner mitochondrial membrane. {MPTP} opening enables free passage into the mitochondria of molecules of \&lt; 1.5 {kDa} including protons. The resulting uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation leads to {ATP} depletion and necrotic cell death and it is now widely recognised that {MPTP} opening is a major cause of reperfusion injury and an effective target for cardioprotection. The properties of the {MPTP} are well defined, but despite extensive research in many laboratories, its exact molecular identity remains uncertain. Knockout studies have confirmed a role for cyclophilin-D ({CyP}-D), probably mediated by its peptidyl-prolyl cis–trans isomerase activity facilitating a conformational change of an inner membrane protein. However, the identity of the membrane component(s) remains controversial. Knockout studies have eliminated an essential role for either the voltage dependent anion channel ({VDAC}) or the adenine nucleotide translocase ({ANT}), although a regulatory role for the {ANT} was confirmed. Our own studies implicate the mitochondrial phosphate carrier ({PiC}) in {MPTP} formation and are consistent with a calcium-triggered conformational change of the {PiC}, facilitated by {CyP}-D, inducing pore opening. We propose that this is enhanced by an association of the {PiC} with the “c” conformation of the {ANT}. Agents that modulate pore opening may act on either or both the {PiC} and the {ANT}. However, knockdown and reconstitution studies are awaited to confirm or refute this model.},

Several contributions to the growing recognition of classical neurotransmitter colocalization and cotransmission originate from studies using invertebrate nervous systems. Some of these model systems contain large identified neurons that contribute to well-understood circuits and networks. They therefore enable investigators to pose questions that are presently beyond the technical limitations of experimental approaches to mammalian brain function. This chapter reviews our current understanding of classical neurotransmitter colocalization and cotransmission in invertebrates. It focuses on identified neurons that could enable assessment of cotransmitter contributions to synaptic signals and neural network function. Major gaps in our present conception of classical neurotransmitter colocalization and cotransmission are emphasized, with an aim toward stimulating further study of their physiological and functional consequences.},

Specific cell adhesion molecules ({CAMs}) accumulate at pre- and postsynaptic sites and trigger synaptic differentiation through interactions with intra- and extracellular scaffolds. These interactions are important to align pre- and postsynaptic transduction machineries and to couple the sites of cell-to-cell adhesion to the cytoskeleton and signaling complexes necessary to accumulate and recycle presynaptic vesicles, components of exo- and endocytic zones, and postsynaptic receptors. In mature brains, {CAMs} contribute to regulation of synaptic efficacy and plasticity, partially via direct interactions with postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors and presynaptic voltage-gated ion channels. This chapter is to highlight the major classes of synaptic {CAMs}, their multiple functions, and the multistage concerted interactions between different {CAMs} and other components of synapses.},

This mechanism is thought to underlie some brain rhythms, in particular gamma frequency (30–80 Hz) oscillations in the hippocampus and neocortex. Here we show that synchronization by an inhibitory input pulse often fails for populations of classical Hodgkin–Huxley neurons. Our reasoning suggests that in general, synchronization by inhibitory input pulses can fail when the transition of the target neurons from rest to spiking involves a Hopf bifurcation, especially when inhibition is shunting, not hyperpolarizing. Surprisingly, synchronization is more likely to fail when the inhibitory pulse is stronger or longer-lasting. These findings have potential implications for the question which neurons participate in brain rhythms, in particular in gamma oscillations.},

	abstract = {Excitatory brain synapses are strengthened or weakened in response to specific patterns of synaptic activation, and these changes in synaptic strength are thought to underlie persistent pathologies such as drug addiction, as well as learning. In contrast, there are few examples of synaptic plasticity of inhibitory {GABA} (-aminobutyric acid)-releasing synapses. Here we report long-term potentiation of {GABAA}-mediated synaptic transmission ({LTPGABA}) onto dopamine neurons of the rat brain ventral tegmental area, a region required for the development of drug addiction. This novel form of {LTP} is heterosynaptic, requiring postsynaptic {NMDA} (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptor activation at glutamate synapses, but resulting from increased {GABA} release at neighbouring inhibitory nerve terminals. {NMDA} receptor activation produces nitric oxide, a retrograde signal released from the postsynaptic dopamine neuron. Nitric oxide initiates {LTPGABA} by activating guanylate cyclase in {GABA}-releasing nerve terminals. Exposure to morphine both in vitro and in vivo prevents {LTPGABA}. Whereas brief treatment with morphine in vitro blocks {LTPGABA} by inhibiting presynaptic glutamate release, in vivo exposure to morphine persistently interrupts signalling from nitric oxide to guanylate cyclase. These neuroadaptations to opioid drugs might contribute to early stages of addiction, and may potentially be exploited therapeutically using drugs targeting {GABAA} receptors.},

For novel information and motivational events such as rewards, this signal at hippocampal {CA}1 synapses is mediated by the neuromodulator, dopamine.

Whereas over the past decade considerable progress has been made in identifying postsynaptic mechanisms for synaptic plasticity, the presynaptic mechanisms involved have remained largely elusive. Recent evidence implicates that second messenger regulation of the protein interactions in synaptic vesicle release machinery is one mechanism by which cellular events modulate synaptic transmission. Thus, identifying protein kinases and their targets in nerve terminals, particularly those functionally regulated by synaptic activity or intracellular [Ca2+], is critical to the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying modulation of neurotransmitter release and presynaptic plasticity. The phosphorylation and dephosphorylation states of synaptic proteins that mediate vesicle exocytosis could regulate the biochemical pathways leading from synaptic vesicle docking to fusion. However, functional evaluation of the activity-dependent phosphorylation events for modulating presynaptic functions still represents a considerable challenge. Here, we present a brief overview of the data on the newly identified candidate targets of the second messenger-activated protein kinases in the presynaptic release machinery and discuss the potential impact of these phosphorylation events in synaptic strength and presynaptic plasticity.},

During fusion, vesicular and target {SNARE} proteins assemble into an α-helical trans-{SNARE} complex that forces the two membranes tightly together, and {SM} proteins likely wrap around assembling trans-{SNARE} complexes to catalyze membrane fusion. After fusion, {SNARE} complexes are dissociated by the {ATPase} {NSF} (for “N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor”). Fusion-competent conformations of {SNARE} proteins are maintained by chaperone complexes composed of {CSPα}, Hsc70, and {SGT}, and by nonenzymatically acting synuclein chaperones; dysfunction of these chaperones results in neurodegeneration.

Using a cell-free, lysed synaptosomal membrane preparation, we show that Ca2+ alone is sufficient to trigger secretion of glutamate and furthermore that Ca(2+)-signaled exocytosis is effectively blocked by antibodies and peptides to {SNAP}-25, a key constituent of the vesicle docking complex. In addition, Ca2+ inhibits the ability of synaptotagmin, a synaptic vesicle protein proposed as a calcium sensor and triggering device, to associate with this docking complex.

	abstract = {Use-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity have been extensively characterized at chemical synapses, but a relationship between natural activity and strength at electrical synapses remains elusive. The thalamic reticular nucleus ({TRN}), a brain area rich in gap-junctional (electrical) synapses, regulates cortical attention to the sensory surround and participates in shifts between arousal states; plasticity of electrical synapses may be a key mechanism underlying these processes. We observed long-term depression resulting from coordinated burst firing in pairs of coupled {TRN} neurons. Changes in gap-junctional communication were asymmetrical, indicating that regulation of connectivity depends on the direction of use. Modification of electrical synapses resulting from activity in coupled neurons is likely to be a widespread and powerful mechanism for dynamic reorganization of electrically coupled neuronal networks.},

	abstract = {Many neurons in the mammalian central nervous system communicate through electrical synapses, defined here as gap junction–mediated connections. Electrical synapses are reciprocal pathways for ionic current and small organic molecules. They are often strong enough to mediate close synchronization of subthreshold and spiking activity among clusters of neurons. The most thoroughly studied electrical synapses occur between excitatory projection neurons of the inferior olivary nucleus and between inhibitory interneurons of the neocortex, hippocampus, and thalamus. All these synapses require the gap junction protein connexin36 (Cx36) for robust electrical coupling. Cx36 appears to interconnect neurons exclusively, and it is expressed widely along the mammalian neuraxis, implying that there are undiscovered electrical synapses throughout the central nervous system. Some central neurons may be electrically coupled by other connexin types or by pannexins, a newly described family of gap junction proteins. Electrical synapses are a ubiquitous yet underappreciated feature of neural circuits in the mammalian brain.},

	isbn = {978-5-382-00808-0},
	abstract = {Вниманию читателя предлагается знаменитая и ставшая классической в нейробиологии книга "От нейрона к мозгу", авторы которой - широко известные ученые-нейробиологи - в ясном и доходчивом стиле описывают существующие факты, методические подходы и концепции, делая упор на экспериментальные данные, как классические, так и самые современные. Авторы объясняют поведение и сложные функции мозга в терминах активности нервных клеток (нейронов); рассматривают клеточные и молекулярные механизмы межнейронного взаимодействия; изучают способы образования структур и связей, которые лежат в основе функций развивающегося организма. Книга снабжена огромным количеством иллюстраций; просто и четко излагаются не только каждая проблема, но и откуда она появилась, как связана с другими вопросами нейробиологии. Очень приятной особенностью книги является то, что авторы не опускают спорные вопросы, четко описывают альтернативные точки зрения и не стесняются сказать, что многие основные проблемы в настоящее время не решены. 
 Первое английское издание книги вышло в 1975 году; оно было переведено на русский язык и стало настольным справочником по основным вопросам физиологии мозга для нескольких поколений исследователей. Четвертое английское издание, с которого выполнен настоящий перевод, обновлено более чем на три четверти и является, по сути, совершенно новой книгой, так как бурный рост науки о мозге привел к удивительным открытиям в последние десятилетия. Но цель книги осталась той же, что была объявлена авторами в предисловии к первому изданию: "...описать способы передачи сигналов нервными клетками, как сигналы анализируются и как на основе этой интеграции возникают высшие функции мозга. Книга предназначена читателю без специального образования, который интересуется принципами работы нервной системы". 

 Настоящее издание входит как рекомендованная литература практически во все курсы, касающиеся работы мозга, для студентов медицинских и биологических вузов России. Книга поможет студентам медицинских и биологических факультетов вузов в получении и освоении знаний о нервной системе. Она будет полезна и исследователям в этой области, равно как и представителям других естественно-научных дисциплин, в том числе физикам, инженерам и молекулярным биологам.},

	abstract = {The raphe nuclei are distributed near the midline of the brainstem along its entire rostro-caudal extension. The serotonergic neurons are their main neuronal components, although a proportion of them lie in subdivisions of the lateral reticular formation. They develop from mesopontine and medullary primordia, and the resulting grouping into rostral and caudal clusters is maintained into adulthood, and is reflected in the connectivity. Thus, the mesencephalon and rostral pons, neurons within the rostral raphe complex (caudal linear, dorsal raphe, and median raphe nuclei) project primarily to the forebrain. By contrast, in the caudal pons and medulla oblongata, neurons within the caudal raphe complex (raphe magnus, raphe obscurus, raphe pallidus nuclei and parts of the adjacent lateral reticular formation) project to the brainstem nuclei and to the spinal cord. The median raphe and dorsal raphe nuclei provide parallel and overlapping projections to many forebrain structures with axon fibers exhibiting distinct structural and functional characteristics. The caudal group of the serotonergic system projects to the brainstem, and, by three parallel projections, to the dorsal, intermediate and ventral columns in the spinal cord. The serotonergic axons arborize over large areas comprising functionally diverse targets. Some projections form classical chemical synapses while many do not, thus contributing to the so-called paracrine or volume transmission. The serotonergic projections participate in the regulation of different functional (motor, somatosensory, limbic) systems; and have been associated with a wide range of neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. Finally, recent experimental data support the role of serotonin in modulating brain development, such that a dysfunction in serotonergic transmission during early life could lead to long lasting structural and functional alterations.},

	abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that Ca2+-permeable {AMPA} receptors display rapid, short-lasting current facilitation. In this study, we investigated the properties of {AMPA} receptor-mediated synaptic currents in medial septal neurons of the rat in an in vitro slice preparation. Immunocytochemistry with a selective antibody to the {GluR}2 subunit revealed that both choline acetyltransferase-containing and parvalbumin-containing neurons of the medial septum express no detectable {GluR}2 subunit immunoreactivity. We used whole cell voltage-clamp recordings to measure synaptically evoked {AMPA} receptor-mediated currents from medial septal neurons following stimulation of midline afferents. The {GYKI} 52466 (50 μM)- and 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide ({NBQX}) (20 μM)-sensitive {AMPA} receptor-mediated component of the synaptic response was isolated by blocking {GABAA}- {andN}-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-mediated currents with 30 μM bicuculline and 100 μM 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid, respectively. In some cases, patched cells were filled with Lucifer yellow (0.1\%) and imaged using 2-photon laser scanning microscopy. {AMPA} receptor-mediated currents that were observed in large medial septal neurons (20–30 μm) displayed rectification. These currents were sensitive to external application of philanthotoxin-343 ({PhTx}-343, 50 μM), a potent, high-affinity antagonist of Ca2+-permeable, {GluR}2-lacking {AMPA} receptors. Rectifying {AMPA} receptor-mediated currents also displayed a rapid increase in amplitude when evoked five times at low frequency such as 6 Hz. In contrast to currents observed in large medial septal neurons, {AMPA}-receptor mediated currents evoked in the remaining small (8–11 μm) neurons were nonrectifying and displayed rapid synaptic depression when stimulated five times at 6 Hz. The currents evoked in these cells were unaffected by external application of {PhTx}-343 and were therefore {GluR}2-containing {AMPA} receptors. The results of the present study demonstrate that the principal projection neurons of the medial septum contain {PhTx}-343-sensitive, {GluR}2-lacking {AMPA} receptors that display rapid current facilitation when stimulated at low frequencies.},

	abstract = {{GABAergic} septohippocampal neurons play a major role in the generation of hippocampal theta rhythm, but modulatory factors intervening in this function are poorly documented. The neuropeptide somatostatin ({SST}) may be one of these factors, because nearly all hippocampal {GABAergic} neurons projecting to the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca ({MS}-{DB}) express {SST}. In this study, we took advantage of the high and selective expression of the {SST} receptor sst2A in {MS}-{DB} to examine its possible role on theta-related activity. Immunohistochemical experiments demonstrated that sst2A receptors were selectively targeted to the somatodendritic domain of neurons expressing the {GABAergic} marker {GAD}67 but were not expressed by cholinergic neurons. In addition, a subpopulation of {GABAergic} septohippocampal projecting neurons expressing parvalbumin ({PV}) also displayed sst2A receptors. Using in vivo juxtacellular recording and labeling with neurobiotin, we showed that a number of bursting and nonbursting neurons exhibiting high discharge rates and brief spikes were immunoreactive for {PV} or {GAD}67 and expressed the sst2A receptor. Microiontophoresis applications of {SST} and the sst2A agonist octreotide ({OCT}) showed that sst2A receptor activation decreased the discharge rate of both nonbursting and bursting {MS}-{DB} neurons and lessened the rhythmic activity of the latter. Finally, intraseptal injections of {OCT} and {SST} in freely moving rats reduced the power of hippocampal {EEG} in the theta band. Together, these in vivo experiments suggest that {SST} action on {MS}-{DB} {GABAergic} neurons, through sst2A receptors, represents an important modulatory mechanism in the control of theta activity.},

	abstract = {The influence of the medial septal nucleus and the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca ({MS}-{DB}) on the hippocampal theta rhythm includes both cholinergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid ({GABAergic}) components. To understand the intrinsic septal interactions and the separate contributions of the cholinergic and {GABAergic} septohippocampal neurons to the theta rhythm in behaving animals, it is essential to be able to identify these two classes from extracellular recordings. Here the durations of extracellularly recorded action potentials are compared with the other characteristics of the neurons. Extracellular recordings were taken from neurons of the {MS}-{DB} both in freely moving rats (114 cells) and in urethane-anesthetized rats (112 cells). These were compared with intracellular recordings taken from {MS}-{DB} neurons in urethane-anesthetized rats (58 cells). Hippocampal {EEG} was recorded from above the {CA}1 pyramidal cell layer ({CAI} theta) and near the hippocampal fissure (dentate theta) to compare the firing phase across cells. Here it is shown that two major types of rhythmically bursting cells in the {MS}-{DB} that had been distinguished previously in intracellular recordings in vivo are also separable in extracellular recordings in vivo on the basis of the durations of their action potentials. In both awake and anesthetized rats the main properties of the two cell types were found to differ: firing rate, phase-relation to the hippocampal theta rhythm and sensitivity of their rhythmicity to blockade of muscarinic transmission. As was previously shown for intracellular recordings in anesthetized rats, it is shown here that in awake rats, too, the more rapidly firing brief-spike (putative {GABAergic}) cells fired with highest probability on the negative phase of the dentate theta, whereas the more slowly firing long-spike (putative cholinergic) cells fired mostly on the positive phase. Previous work showed that in intracellular recordings from anesthetized rats the rhythmic firing of most brief-spike cells was still retained even during muscarinic blockade, but that of most long-spike cells was lost. Here we also report a recategorization according to spike duration of existing extracellular recordings taken from anesthetized rats, confirming the above observation with much larger numbers of cells. Three additional major new findings are also reported here. (1) In awake rats, muscarinic blockade has relatively little effect on either cell type. (2) Under anesthesia, the firing rates of both cell types are lower than in awake rats, but the effect is greater on the long-spike cells, where the anesthesia also reduces the rhythmicity of the cell firing. (3) Rhythmicity of the putative {GABAergic} cells is also retained after local injection of {GABA}-A antagonist, whereas that of the putative cholinergic cells is eliminated. We conclude that either systemic muscarinic blockade or urethane anesthesia alone have relatively little effect on neurons in the defined above {MS}-{DB}, but a combination of the two has profound effects on the rhythmicity of the cholinergic cells, largely sparing the {GABA}-ergic cells. Taken together, the results suggest that generation of theta rhythm requires a background of excitatory influences on the hippocampus (that can be maintained by either muscarinic or glutamatergic inputs) in combination with the phasic disinhibitory action mediated by the {GABAergic} {MS}-{DB} projection. They also provide additional support for the notion that the phasic activity in local collaterals of {GABAergic} {MS}-{DB} cells contributes to the phasic modulation of the firing of cholinergic septohippocampal neurons.},

A {GABAergic} neuron type in the {MS}/{DB} that has fast spiking properties was shown previously to contain parvalbumin immunoreactivity and to form axosomatic connections with unidentified somata. The aim in the current study was to determine the neurochemical identities of these target neurons. In slices and in perfused-fixed brain, staining for parvalbumin immunoreactivity first of all revealed the presence of two types of parvalbumin-positive somata in the {MS}/{DB}: medially located neurons with parvalbumin-positive basket-like terminals on them, and more laterally located neurons with fewer parvalbumin-positive contacts on them. In {MS}/{DB} slices, the terminals of fast spiking neurons filled with biocytin correspondingly made either numerous contacts that surrounded the parvalbumin-positive cell body in basket-like formation, or 1-5 contacts on a localized patch of the soma. These contacts were shown by electron microscopy to form synaptic junctions. No terminals of biocytin-filled fast spiking neurons were observed on cholinergic neurons, and dual staining in perfused-fixed brain did not reveal the presence of parvalbumin-containing terminals on cholinergic somata. Our results suggest therefore that there are two subtypes of parvalbumin-containing neuron in the {MS}/{DB}, and that these are interconnected via axosomatic synapses. The contrasting topographical organization of the two types of parvalbumin-containing neuron suggests that they may receive different types of afferent input, but this will require substantiation in future studies. We propose that generation of rhythmic activity in the {MS}/{DB} is controlled by contrasting contributions from two types of parvalbumin-positive neuron, and that the role of the cholinergic neuron is modulatory.},

We then summarize more recent data in mice and zebrafish that support a genetic diversity of 5-{HT} neurons, based on differential transcription factor requirements for the acquisition of the 5-{HT} identity. In both species, {PET}1 plays a major role in the acquisition and maintenance of 5-{HT} identity in the hindbrain, although some 5-{HT} neurons do not require {PET}1 for their differentiation, indicating the existence of several transcriptional routes to become serotoninergic. In mice, both {PET}1-dependent and -independent 5-{HT} neurons are located in the raphe, but have distinct anatomical features, such as the morphology of axon terminals and projection patterns. In zebrafish, all raphe neurons express pet1, but Pet1-independent 5-{HT} cell groups are present in the forebrain. Overall, these observations support the view that there are a number of distinct 5-{HT} subsystems, including within the raphe nuclei, with unique genetic programming and functions.},

	abstract = {Information processing in the hippocampus critically relies on its reciprocal interaction with the medial septum ({MS}). Synchronization of the septo-hippocampal system was demonstrated during both major hippocampal activity states, the regular theta rhythm and the large amplitude irregular activity. Previous experimental and modeling data suggest that the {MS} provides rhythmic drive to the hippocampus, and hippocampo-septal feedback synchronizes septal pacemaker units. However, this view has recently been questioned based on the possibility of intrahippocampal theta genesis. Previously, we identified putative pacemaker neurons expressing parvalbumin ({PV}) and/or the pacemaker hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic nucleotide-gated nonselective cation channel ({HCN}) in the {MS}. In this study, by analyzing the temporal relationship of activity between the {PV}/{HCN}-containing medial septal neurons and hippocampal local field potential, we aimed to uncover whether the sequence of events during theta formation supports the classic view of septal drive or the challenging theory of hippocampal pacing of theta. Importantly, by implementing a circular statistical method, a temporal lead of these septal neurons over the hippocampus was observed on the course of theta synchronization. Moreover, the activity of putative hippocampal interneurons also preceded hippocampal local field theta, but by a shorter time period compared with {PV}/{HCN}-containing septal neurons. Using the concept of mutual information, the action potential series of {PV}/{HCN}-containing neurons shared higher amount of information with hippocampal field oscillation than {PV}/{HCN}-immunonegative cells. Thus, a pacemaker neuron population of the {MS} leads hippocampal activity, presumably via the synchronization of hippocampal interneurons.},

	abstract = {Synchronous rhythms represent a core mechanism for sculpting temporal coordination of neural activity in the brain-wide network. This review focuses on oscillations in the cerebral cortex that occur during cognition, in alert behaving conditions. Over the last two decades, experimental and modeling work has made great strides in elucidating the detailed cellular and circuit basis of these rhythms, particularly gamma and theta rhythms. The underlying physiological mechanisms are diverse (ranging from resonance and pacemaker properties of single cells to multiple scenarios for population synchronization and wave propagation), but also exhibit unifying principles. A major conceptual advance was the realization that synaptic inhibition plays a fundamental role in rhythmogenesis, either in an interneuronal network or in a reciprocal excitatory-inhibitory loop. Computational functions of synchronous oscillations in cognition are still a matter of debate among systems neuroscientists, in part because the notion of regular oscillation seems to contradict the common observation that spiking discharges of individual neurons in the cortex are highly stochastic and far from being clocklike. However, recent findings have led to a framework that goes beyond the conventional theory of coupled oscillators and reconciles the apparent dichotomy between irregular single neuron activity and field potential oscillations. From this perspective, a plethora of studies will be reviewed on the involvement of long-distance neuronal coherence in cognitive functions such as multisensory integration, working memory, and selective attention. Finally, implications of abnormal neural synchronization are discussed as they relate to mental disorders like schizophrenia and autism.},

We have used biophysical modeling to address two major questions raised by the septal pacemaker hypothesis: what is the ion channel mechanism for the single-cell pacemaker behavior and how do these cells become synchronized? Our model predicts that theta oscillations of septal {GABAergic} cells depend critically on a low-threshold, slowly inactivating potassium current. Network simulations show that theta oscillations are not coherent in an isolated population of pacemaker cells. Robust synchronization emerges with the addition of a second {GABAergic} cell population. Such a reciprocally inhibitory circuit can be realized by the hippocampo-septal feedback loop.},

A widely accepted model posits that {LTP} requires the cytoplasmic carboxyl tail (C-tail) of the {AMPA} (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptor subunit {GluA}1. To find the minimum necessary requirement of the {GluA}1 C-tail for {LTP} in mouse {CA}1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons, we used a single-cell molecular replacement strategy to replace all endogenous {AMPA} receptors with transfected subunits. In contrast to the prevailing model, we found no requirement of the {GluA}1 C-tail for {LTP}. In fact, replacement with the {GluA}2 subunit showed normal {LTP}, as did an artificially expressed kainate receptor not normally found at these synapses. The only conditions under which {LTP} was impaired were those with markedly decreased {AMPA} receptor surface expression, indicating a requirement for a reserve pool of receptors. These results demonstrate the synapse's remarkable flexibility to potentiate with a variety of glutamate receptor subtypes, requiring a fundamental change in our thinking with regard to the core molecular events underlying synaptic plasticity.},

The parallel processing in the brain stem auditory pathways provides an excellent model system for investigating the functional implications of short-term plasticity in neural coding. We review recent evidence that short-term plasticity differs in different pathways with a special emphasis on the ‘intensity’ pathway. While short-term depression dominates the ‘timing’ pathway, the intensity pathway is characterized by a balance of short-term depression and facilitation that allows linear transmission of rate-coded intensity information. Target-specific regulation of presynaptic plasticity mechanisms underlies the differential expression of depression and facilitation. The potential contribution of short-term plasticity to different aspects of ‘intensity’-related information processing, such as interaural level/intensity difference coding, amplitude modulation coding, and intensity-dependent gain control coding, is discussed.},

This seemingly innocuous feature challenges our current understanding of the synaptic mechanisms underlying {WM}. Here we argue that in {WM} the prefrontal cortex ({PFC}) operates in a regime of balanced excitation and inhibition and that the observed temporal irregularity reflects this regime. We show that this requires that nonlinearities underlying the persistent activity are primarily in the neuronal interactions between {PFC} neurons. We also show that short-term synaptic facilitation can be the physiological substrate of these nonlinearities and that the resulting mechanism of balanced persistent activity is robust, in particular with respect to changes in the connectivity. As an example, we put forward a computational model of the {PFC} circuit involved in oculomotor delayed response task. The novelty of this model is that recurrent excitatory synapses are facilitating. We demonstrate that this model displays direction-selective persistent activity. We find that, even though the memory eventually degrades because of the heterogeneities, it can be stored for several seconds for plausible network size and connectivity. This model accounts for a large number of experimental findings, such as the findings that have shown that firing is more irregular during the persistent state than during baseline, that the neuronal responses are very diverse, and that the preferred directions during cue and delay periods are strongly correlated but tuning widths are not.},

	abstract = {The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex ({PDHc}) is a mitochondrial matrix multienzyme complex that provides the link between glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid ({TCA}) cycle by catalyzing the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-{CoA}. {PDHc} deficiency is one of the commoner metabolic disorders of lactic acidosis presenting with neurological phenotypes that vary with age and gender. In this mini-review, we postulate mechanisms of epilepsy in the setting of {PDHc} deficiency using two illustrative cases (one with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex E1-alpha polypeptide ({PDHA}1) deficiency and the second one with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex E1-beta subunit ({PDHB}) deficiency (a rare subtype of {PDHc} deficiency)) and a selected review of published case series. {PDHc} plays a critical role in the pathway of carbohydrate metabolism and energy production. In severe deficiency states the resulting energy deficit impacts on brain development in utero resulting in structural brain anomalies and epilepsy. Milder deficiency states present with variable manifestations that include cognitive delay, ataxia, and seizures. Epileptogenesis in {PDHc} deficiency is linked to energy failure, development of structural brain anomalies and abnormal neurotransmitter metabolism. The use of the ketogenic diet bypasses the metabolic block, by providing a direct source of acetyl-{CoA}, leading to amelioration of some symptoms.

Fructose-1,6-diphosphate ({FDP}), which inhibits glycolysis and diverts glucose into the pentose phosphate pathway, has strong inhibitory action on seizures induced by chemical convulsants. Here, we investigated the effect of {FDP} on a rat model of rapid hippocampal kindling. After determining the after-discharge threshold ({ADT}), the seizure severity and after-discharge duration ({ADD}) were measured to study the antiepileptogenic effects of {FDP} (0.5 or 1.0 g/kg i.p. for 4 days). The {mRNA} expression levels of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor ({BDNF}) and its principal receptor {TrkB}, which are key modulators of seizure activity, were determined in the ipsilateral hippocampus by real-time polymerase chain reaction ({RT}-{PCR}). High-dose {FDP} (1.0 g/kg) delayed kindling development together with shortened {ADD}, and high-dose treated rats also needed more kindling stimulations and more cumulative {ADD} to stage 4. However, it showed no significant antiepileptogenic effect at a lower dose of 0.5 g/kg. In addition, {FDP} attenuated {BDNF} and {TrkB} expression before and during kindling procedure; this result indicated that {BDNF}/{TrkB} signaling pathway may participate in the antiepileptogenic action of {FDP}. Our data demonstrates that {FDP} has a significant antiepileptogenic effect in kindling seizures and that it may be a potential antiepileptic drug in the future.},

It is achieved through the coordinated regulation of neuronal circuits that control a wide range of physiological processes affecting energy intake and expenditure, such as feeding, metabolic rate, locomotor activity, arousal, growth and reproduction. Neuronal populations distributed throughout the {CNS} but highly enriched in the mediobasal hypothalamus, sense hormonal, nutrient and neuronal signals of systemic energy status and relay this information to secondary neurons that integrate the information and regulate distinct physiological parameters in a manner that promotes energy homeostasis. To achieve this, it is critical that neuronal circuits provide information about short-term changes in nutrient availability in the larger context of long-term energy status. For example, the same signals lead to different cellular and physiological responses if delivered under fasted versus fed conditions. Thus, there is a clear need to have mechanisms that rapidly and reversibly adjust responsiveness of hypothalamic circuits to acute changes in nutrient availability.},

Thus, nitric oxide inhibits cytochrome c oxidase activity in neurones and glia, resulting in down-regulation of mitochondrial energy production. The subsequent increase in {AMP} facilitates the activation of 5′-{AMP}-dependent protein kinase, which rapidly triggers the activation of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase – the master regulator of the glycolytic pathway – and Glut1 and Glut3 — the main glucose transporters in the brain. In addition, nitric oxide activates glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, the first and rate-limiting step of the pentose–phosphate pathway. Here, we review recent evidences suggesting that nitric oxide exerts a fine control of neuronal energy metabolism by tuning the balance of glucose-6-phosphate consumption between glycolysis and pentose–phosphate pathway.

Within the brain, neurons are the cells most vulnerable to excess reactive oxygen and nitrogen species; their survival relies on the antioxidant protection promoted by neighbouring astrocytes. However, neurons are also intrinsically equipped with a biochemical mechanism that links glucose metabolism to antioxidant defence. Neurons actively metabolize glucose through the pentose phosphate pathway, which maintains the antioxidant glutathione in its reduced state, hence exerting neuroprotection. This process is tightly controlled by a key glycolysis-promoting enzyme and is dependent on an appropriate supply of energy substrates from astrocytes. Thus brain bioenergetic and antioxidant defence is coupled between neurons and astrocytes. A better understanding of the regulation of this intercellular coupling should be important for identifying novel targets for future therapeutic interventions.},

Because a single spine is physically very small, chemical reactions at it are essentially stochastic, and thus sensitivity–longevity dilemma exists in the synaptic memory. Here, the cascade of excitable and bistable dynamics is proposed to overcome this difficulty. All kinds of learning algorithms in different brain regions confront with difficult generalization problems. For resolution of this issue, the control of the degrees-of-freedom can be realized by changing synchronicity of neural firing. Especially, for cerebellar supervised learning, the triangle closed-loop circuit consisting of Purkinje cells, the inferior olive nucleus, and the cerebellar nucleus is proposed as a circuit to optimally control synchronous firing and degrees-of-freedom in learning.},

The four calcium-binding sites are assumed to be nonidentical. The model is consistent with previously reported experimental data for calcium binding to calmodulin. It also accounts for known properties of calmodulin that have been difficult to model so far, including the activity of nonsaturated forms of calmodulin (we predict the existence of open conformations in the absence of calcium), an increase in calcium affinity once calmodulin is bound to a target, and the differential activation of {CaMKII} and {PP}2B depending on calcium concentration.},

It is proposed that the quantitative level of the activity-dependent rise in postsynaptic Ca2+ determines whether the synaptic weight will increase or decrease. It is further proposed that reduction of synaptic weight is governed by protein phosphatase 1, an enzyme indirectly controlled by Ca2+ through reactions involving phosphatase inhibitor 1, {cAMP}-dependent protein kinase, calcineurin, and adenylate cyclase. Modeling of this biochemical system shows that it can function as an analog computer that can store a synaptic weight and modify it in accord with the Hebb and anti-Hebb learning rules.},

The model describes the activation of receptors, G-proteins, and production of {cAMP} as the first stage and uses first-order, non-rate-limited kinetics. The second stage corresponds to the release of active, {PKA} catalytic subunit and can use first- or higher-order kinetics. The third stage represents simple phosphorylation of ion channels and is limited by the number of channels available. The decay of each stage is based on first-order, mass-action kinetics. These equations and some variations were solved numerically and values of the parameters were determined by fitting to a variety of experimental data from myenteric neurons of the guinea-pig ileum. The model produced a slow {EPSP} with a nonlinear stimulus-response relationship that resulted from the underlying kinetics of the signaling cascade. This system of equations is suitable for incorporation into a large-scale computer simulation, and the methodology should be generalizable to other pathways.},

	abstract = {Activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase {II} ({CaMKII}) by calmodulin following calcium entry into the cell is important for long-term potentiation ({LTP}). Here a model of calmodulin binding and trapping by {CaMKII} in a dendritic spine was used to estimate levels and durations of {CaMKII} activation following {LTP}-inducing tetani. The calcium signal was calcium influx through {NMDA} receptor channels computed in a highly detailed dentate granule cell model. Calcium could bind to calmodulin and calmodulin to {CaMKII}. {CaMKII} subunits were either free, bound with calmodulin, trapped, autonomous, or capped. Strong low-frequency tetanic input produced little calmodulin trapping or {CaMKII} activation. Strong high-frequency tetanic input caused large numbers of {CaMKII} subunits to become trapped, and {CaMKII} was strongly activated. Calmodulin trapping and {CaMKII} activation were highly dependent on tetanus frequency (particularly between 10 and 100 Hz) and were highly sensitive to relatively small changes in the calcium signal. Repetition of a short high-frequency tetanus was necessary to achieve high levels of {CaMKII} activation. Three stages of {CaMKII} activation were found in the model: a short, highly activated stage; an intermediate, moderately active stage; and a long-lasting third stage, whose duration depended on dephosphorylation rates but whose decay rate was faster at low {CaMKII} activation levels than at high levels. It is not clear which of these three stages is most important for {LTP}.},

Until now the kinase that phosphorylates Ser(67) had not been identified and the physiological role of Ser(67) phosphorylation was unknown. In this study we detected a high level of kinase activity in brain extract when a glutathione S-transferase ({GST}) fusion I-1 mutant containing an Ala substituted for Thr(35) [{GST}-I-1(T35A)] was used as the substrate. {GST}-I-1(T35A) kinase and neuronal cdc2-like protein kinase ({NCLK}) in the brain extract could not be separated from each other by a series of sequential chromatographies. {GST}-I-1(T35A) kinase immunoprecipitated with anti-{NCLK} antibody from kinase-active column fractions.

We propose an allosteric model for calmodulin activation, in which binding to calcium facilitates the transition between a low-affinity [tense (T)] and a high-affinity [relaxed (R)] state. The four calcium-binding sites are assumed to be nonidentical. The model is consistent with previously reported experimental data for calcium binding to calmodulin. It also accounts for known properties of calmodulin that have been difficult to model so far, including the activity of nonsaturated forms of calmodulin (we predict the existence of open conformations in the absence of calcium), an increase in calcium affinity once calmodulin is bound to a target, and the differential activation of {CaMKII} and {PP}2B depending on calcium concentration.},

We find that phosphatases have a more pronounced effect than kinases on the rate and duration of signaling, whereas signal amplitude is controlled primarily by kinases. The simplest model pathways allow amplified signaling only at the expense of slow signal propagation. More complex and realistic pathways can combine high amplification and signaling rates with maintenance of a stable off-state. Our models also explain how different agonists can evoke transient or sustained signaling of the same pathway and provide a rationale for signaling pathway design.},

We recently reported that p53 directly induces oligomerization of the {BH}1,2,3 effector protein Bak, leading to outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization ({OMMP}) with release of apoptotic activator proteins. One important mechanism by which p53 achieves {OMMP} is by forming an inhibitory complex with the anti-apoptotic {BclXL} protein. In contrast, the p53 complex with the Bcl2 homolog has not been interrogated. Here we have undertaken a detailed characterization of the p53-Bcl2 interaction using structural, biophysical, and mutational analyses. We have identified the p53 {DNA} binding domain as the binding interface for Bcl2 using solution {NMR}. The affinity of the p53-Bcl2 complex was determined by surface plasmon resonance analysis ({BIAcore}) to have a dominant component {KD} 535 +/- 24 nm. Moreover, in contrast to wild type p53, endogenous missense mutants of p53 are unable to form complexes with endogenous Bcl2 in human cancer cells. Functionally, these mutants are all completely or strongly compromised in mediating {OMMP}, as measured by cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria. These data implicate p53-Bcl2 complexes in contributing to the direct mitochondrial p53 pathway of apoptosis and further support the notion that the {DNA} binding domain of p53 is a dual function domain, mediating both its transactivation function and its direct mitochondrial apoptotic function.},

Here, we provide evidence that p53 translocation to the mitochondria occurs in vivo in irradiated thymocytes. Further, we show that the p53 protein can directly induce permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane by forming complexes with the protective {BclXL} and Bcl2 proteins, resulting in cytochrome c release. p53 binds to {BclXL} via its {DNA} binding domain. We probe the significance of mitochondrial p53 and show that tumor-derived transactivation-deficient mutants of p53 concomitantly lose the ability to interact with {BclXL} and promote cytochrome c release.

Bid, or its {BH}3-domain peptide, activated monomeric Bax to produce membrane openings that allowed the passage of very large (2 megadalton) dextran molecules, explaining the translocation of large mitochondrial proteins during apoptosis.

A hypothesis is put forward in which p66shc is assumed to be involved in phenoptosis, i.e., programmed death of an organism, mediated by the reactive oxygen species-dependent massive apoptosis in an organ of vital importance. The reactive oxygen species are suggested to oxidize phosphatidyl serine in the inner leaflet of the cell plasma membrane, resulting in appearance of this phospholipid in the outer membrane leaflet, an effect recognized by a special receptor and causing the p66shc phosphorylation at a serine residue. Serine-phosphorylated p66shc there is proposed to block mitosis and initiate apoptosis. The large-scale apoptosis leads to phenoptosis and, hence, shortens the life span of the organism.},

In Caenorhabditis elegans, this protease is {CED}-3, which corresponds to mammalian caspase-3. Caspases comprise a distinct family of cysteine aspartases that are activated by interaction with a co-factor and/or proteolytic processing. Once activated, they cleave targets containing the exposed consensus sequences, including other caspases, protein kinases and structural elements, to achieve the death of the cell. Apoptotic cells undergo a dramatic volume loss accompanied by ionic shifts and cytoplasmic acidification. The cytoskeleton rearranges and the cell membrane undergoes blebbing and phosphatidylserine externalization, thus marking the dying cell for ingestion by phagocytes. In addition to structural changes, mitochondria cease to synthesize {ATP}, release cytochrome c and other constituents, and lose membrane potential. {DNA} undergoes endonucleolytic cleavage first into 50-kb fragments, followed by cleavage to oligonucleosomes. Together these biochemical processes achieve the noninflammatory destruction of the cell.},

Although knock-out studies have confirmed critical roles for both cyclophilin-D ({CyP}-D) and the adenine nucleotide translocase ({ANT}), given a strong enough stimulus {MPTP} opening can occur in the absence of either. Here we provide evidence that the mitochondrial phosphate carrier ({PiC}) may also be a critical component of the {MPTP}. Phenylarsine oxide ({PAO}) was found to activate {MPTP} opening in the presence of carboxyatractyloside ({CAT}) that prevents {ANT} binding to immobilized {PAO}. Only four proteins from solubilized {CAT}-treated beef heart inner mitochondrial membranes bound to immobilized {PAO}, one of which was the {PiC}. {GST}-{CyP}-D pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed {CsA}-sensitive binding of {PiC} to {CyP}-D; this increased following diamide treatment. Co-immunoprecipitation of the {ANT} with the {PiC} was also observed but was insensitive to {CsA} treatment. N-ethylmaleimide and ubiquinone analogues ({UQ}(0) and Ro 68-3400) inhibited phosphate transport into rat liver mitochondria with the same concentration dependence as their inhibition of {MPTP} opening. {UQ}(0) and Ro 68-3400 also induced the "m" conformation of the {ANT}, as does {NEM}, and reduced the binding of both the {PiC} and {ANT} to the {PAO} column. We propose a model for the {MPTP} in which a calcium-triggered conformational change of the {PiC}, facilitated by {CyP}-D, induces pore opening.

These effects, which are inhibited by cyclosporin A ({CsA}), are fully consistent with the opening of the so-called permeability transition pore. However, when Ca(2+) cycling is abolished by {EGTA}, the mitochondria remain energized ({DeltaPsi} collapse and swelling are avoided), but Ca(2+) efflux, promoted by the chelating agent, is stimulated by menadione. This stimulation goes together with the release of Mg(2+), K(+), and adenine nucleotides ({AdN}) and is inhibited by bongkrekic acid ({BKA}). The effect of menadione is also characterized by biphasic {NAD}(P)H oxidation which becomes monophasic in the presence of {BKA}, {CsA}, or {EGTA} and by the oxidation of thiol groups not restrained by the above-mentioned inhibitors. These results suggest that {BKA} acts indirectly by preserving in the matrix a critical amount of {AdN} without modifying the monophasic oxidation of pyridine nucleotides by menadione. A critical number of thiol groups also seems to be involved in the phenomenon. Their oxidation most probably causes a conformational change on adenine nucleotide translocase with the opening of the "low-conductance state" of the mitochondrial permeability transition, resulting in ion permeability without {DeltaPsi} disruption and mitochondrial swelling.},

The nature of the thiol reagent-induced membrane perturbations was investigated. Modifications of the interactions between membrane components after treatment with thiol reagents were assessed by measuring the binding parameters of 1-anilinonaphtalene-8-sulfonate. An enhancement (about 50\%) of the fluorescence intensity, a weak increase of the number of binding sites, and a decrease of the apparent dissociation constant were observed. However, no significant modification of the net surface charge was detected. The osmotic behavior of mitochondria in hypotonic solutions of sucrose was altered after thiol modification. The outer membrane did not seem to influence the matricial volume expansion when thiols were alkylated. After swelling in an isotonic solution of permeant ions, N-butylmaleimide-treated mitochondrial lost one-half of their malate dehydrogenase content, whereas fumarase and glutamate dehydrogenase did not leave the matrix space. Addition of polyethylene glycol of molecular weight below 6000 to swollen mitochondria induced a rapid but transient shrinkage. In swollen mitochondria, the above results indicate a possible holes formation in the membrane structure. The size of these holes was estimated to be about 3 nm. This process which required the presence of the outer membrane, was favored by increasing the temperature and was antagonized by specific effectors of the adenine nucleotide translocator.},

	volume = {263},
	issn = {0021-9258},
	abstract = {When rat liver mitochondria are allowed to accumulate Ca2+, treated with ruthenium red to inhibit reverse activity of the Ca2+ uniporter, and then treated with an uncoupler, they release Ca2+ and endogenous Mg2+ and undergo large amplitude swelling with ultrastructural expansion of the matrix space. These effects are not produced by Ca2+ plus uncoupler alone. Like other "Ca2+-releasing agents" (i.e. N-ethylmaleimide, t-butylhydroperoxide, oxalacetate, etc.), the development of nonspecific permeability produced by ruthenium red plus uncoupler requires accumulated Ca2+ specifically and is antagonized by inhibitors of phospholipase A2. The permeability responses are also antagonized by ionophore A23187, indicating that a rapid pathway for Ca2+ efflux from deenergized mitochondria is necessary to prevent the development of nonspecific permeability. {EGTA} can be substituted for ruthenium red to produce the nonspecific permeability change in Ca2+-loaded, uncoupler-treated mitochondria. The permeability responses to {EGTA} plus uncoupler again require accumulated Ca2+ specifically and are antagonized by inhibitors of phospholipase A2 and by ionophore A23187. The equivalent effects of ruthenium red and {EGTA} on uncoupled, Ca2+-containing mitochondria indicate that reducing the extramitochondrial Ca2+ concentration to the subnanomolar range produces inhibition of reverse uniport activity. It is proposed that inhibition reflect regulation of the uniporter by a Ca2+ binding site which is available from the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane. {EDTA} cannot substitute for {EGTA} to induce nonspecific permeability in Ca2+-loaded, uncoupled mitochondria. Furthermore, {EDTA} inhibits the response to {EGTA} with an I50 value of approximately 10 {microM}. These data suggest that the uniporter regulatory site also binds Mg2+. The data suggest further that Mg2+ binding to the regulatory site is necessary to inhibit reverse uniport activity, even when the site is not occupied by Ca2+.},

	issn = {0021-9258},
	abstract = {Liver mitochondria treated with N-ethylmaleimide can accumulate Ca2+ but cannot retain it. Ca2+ loss following uptake occurs in parallel with a proton uptake and collapse of the membrane potential. Respiration is not activated during Ca2+ release and cannot be stimulated by uncoupler. After Ca2+ release and accompanying phenomena are nearly complete, the mitochondria undergo a large amplitude swelling. Nupercaine inhibits the premature release of Ca2+, proton uptake, decline in membrane potential, inhibition of uncoupler-stimulated respiration, and large amplitude swelling. Ruthenium red also prevents these effects. Neither Sr2+ or Mn2+ will substitute for Ca2+ to induce these effects in N-ethylmaleimide-treated mitochondria. The effects of N-ethylmaleimide plus Ca2+ on mitochondria are not accompanied by a significant alteration in the content or composition of phospholipids but are accompanied by small increases in the mitochondrial content of free fatty acids. Free fatty acids accumulate more rapidly in response to limited Ca2+ loading in the absence of N-ethylmaleimide than they do in its presence. In the absence of N-ethylmaleimide, polyunsaturated fatty acids and saturated plus monounsaturated fatty acids accumulate at nearly equal rates. In the presence of N-ethylmaleimide, polyunsaturated fatty acids accumulate more rapidly than saturated plus monounsaturated fatty acids. Any condition or agent tested which inhibited swelling and the other effects produced by Ca2+ plus N-ethylmaleimide also prevented the more rapid accumulation of polyunsaturated, compared to saturated plus monounsaturated, fatty acids. In the light of a positional analysis of phospholipid acyl moieties, these data suggest that 1-acyllysophospholipids accumulate in swelling mitochondria but not in response to noraml Ca2+ loading or when swelling is blocked by other agents. The free fatty acid accumulation, per se, is not responsible for swelling, but levels of exogenous palmitic acid as low as 1 nmol/mg of protein dramatically alter the dependence of swelling velocity on Ca2+ concentration, producing a shift from a sigmoidal- to a hyperbolic-like relationship. This same alteration is brought about by aging the mitochondrial preparation at 0 degrees C. Either pyruvate or {DL}-carnitine prevents the effect of exogenous palmitate and restores the Aa2+ swelling dependence of aged N-ethylmaleimide-treated mitochondria to that of fresh N-ethylmaleimide-treated mitochondria. Intramitochondrial acylcoenzyme A or acylcarnitine, or both, therefore, to be the modulator of Ca2+ sensitivity rather than free fatty acid. The findings are discussed in terms of the role of intramitochondrial phospholipase and other phospholipid metabolizing enzymes in the mechanisms of N-ethylmaleimide plus Ca2+ effects on mitochondria.},

	abstract = {It is now well established that incubation of mitochondria at {pH} 8 or higher opens up an electrophoretic anion transport pathway in the inner membrane. It is not known, however, whether this transport process has any physiological relevance. In this communication we demonstrate that anion uniport can take place at physiological {pH} if the mitochondria are depleted of matrix divalent cations with A23187 and {EDTA}. Using the light-scattering technique we have quantitated the rates of uniport of a wide variety of anions. Inorganic anions such as Cl-, {SO}4(2-), and Fe({CN})6(4-) as well as physiologically important anions such as {HCO}3-, Pi-, citrate, and malate are transported. Some anions, however, such as gluconate and glucuronate do not appear to be transported. On the basis of the finding that the rate of anion uniport assayed in ammonium salts exhibits a dramatic decline associated with loss of matrix K+ via K+/H+ antiport, we suggest that anion uniport is inhibited by matrix protons. Direct inhibition of anion uniport by protons in divalent cation-depleted mitochondria is demonstrated, and the apparent {pK} of the binding site is shown to be about 7.8. From these properties we tentatively conclude that anion uniport induced by divalent cation depletion and that induced by elevated {pH} are catalyzed by the same transport pathway, which is regulated by both matrix H+ and Mg2+.},

We also examined whether the effects induced by {BAX}(oligo) or by {BAX}(mono) activated with t(c){BID} depended on induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition. The results obtained in this study revealed that t(c){BID} plus {BAX}(mono) produced {BAX} insertion and Cyt c release without overt changes in mitochondrial morphology. On the contrary, treatment of mitochondria with {BAX}(oligo) resulted in {BAX} insertion and Cyt c release, which were accompanied by gross distortion of mitochondrial morphology. The effects of {BAX}(oligo) could be at least partially suppressed by mitochondrial depolarization. The effects of t(c){BID} plus {BAX}(mono) were insensitive to depolarization. {BAX}(oligo) produced similar {BAX} insertion, mitochondrial remodeling, and Cyt c release in {KCl}- and in N-methyl-D-glucamine-based incubation media indicating a non-essential role for K+ influx into mitochondria in these processes. A combination of cyclosporin A and {ADP}, inhibitors of the mitochondrial permeability transition, attenuated Cyt c release, mitochondrial remodeling, and depolarization induced by {BAX}(oligo), but failed to influence the effects produced by t(c){BID} plus {BAX}(mono). Thus, our results suggest a significant difference in the mechanisms of the outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and Cyt c release induced by detergent-oligomerized {BAX}(oligo) and by {BAX} activated with t(c){BID}.},

The mechanisms of this cooperation are still unclear. Here we show that in isolated brain mitochondria, recombinant {BAX} readily self-integrates/oligomerizes in the {OMM} but produces only a minuscule release of cytochrome c, indicating that {BAX} insertion/oligomerization in the {OMM} does not always lead to massive {OMM} permeabilization. Ca(2+) in a mitochondrial permeability transition ({mPT})-dependent and recombinant {tBID} in an {mPT}-independent manner promoted {BAX} insertion/ oligomerization in the {OMM} and augmented cytochrome c release. Neither {tBID} nor Ca(2+) induced {BAX} oligomerization in the solution without mitochondria, suggesting that {BAX} oligomerization required interaction with the organelles and followed rather than preceded {BAX} insertion in the {OMM}. Recombinant Bcl-{xL} failed to prevent {BAX} insertion/oligomerization in the {OMM} but strongly attenuated cytochrome c release. On the other hand, a reducing agent, dithiothreitol ({DTT}), inhibited {BAX} insertion/oligomerization augmented by {tBID} or Ca(2+) and suppressed the {BAX}-mediated release of cytochrome c and Smac/{DIABLO} but failed to inhibit Ca(2+)-induced swelling. Altogether, these data suggest that in brain mitochondria, {BAX} insertion/oligomerization can be dissociated from {OMM} permeabilization and that {tBID} and Ca(2+) stimulate {BAX} insertion/oligomerization and {BAX}-mediated {OMM} permeabilization by different mechanisms involving {mPT} induction and modulation of the {SH}-redox state.},

	abstract = {Recent studies that attempt to explore the action of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins of the bcl2 family demonstrate the crucial role of relocalization of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the cytosol. This early event of apoptosis can be mimicked in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae following expression of bax. In mammalian mitochondria, the mechanism of relocalization is thought to involve the opening of the so-called permeability transition pore. We show in this paper: (a) that bax-induced release of cytochrome c in yeast does not involve any permeability transition of the inner mitochondrial membrane but involves a general alteration of the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane to macromolecules. This suggests that a permeability transition of the inner mitochondrial membrane is not an event required for the relocalization of cytochrome c in yeast. (b) The outer-membrane voltage-dependent anion channel ({VDAC}), a putative component of the permeability transition pore, is not involved in bax-induced release of cytochrome c or in the prevention of this release by bcl-{xL}. (c) Bax devoid of its C-terminal putative hydrophobic alpha-helix is as efficient as full-length bax to allow the relocalization of cytochrome c, demonstrating this segment of the protein is not required for membrane-targeting. (d) We finally observe that the action of bax on the outer mitochondrial membrane requires the presence of {ATP} both in vitro and in vivo, and it is shown that {ATP} directly increases the amount of bax inserted to mitochondria.},

Like mitochondria, mitoplasts readily underwent a permeability transition following Ca(2+) uptake in a process that maintained sensitivity to cyclosporin A. On the other hand, major differences between mitochondria and mitoplasts emerged in {PTP} regulation by ligands of the outer membrane translocator protein of 18 {kDa}, {TSPO}, formerly known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor. Indeed, (i) in mitoplasts, the {PTP} could not be activated by photo-oxidation after treatment with dicarboxylic porphyrins endowed with protoporphyrin {IX} configuration, which bind {TSPO} in intact mitochondria; and (ii) mitoplasts became resistant to the {PTP}-inducing effects of N,N-dihexyl-2-(4-fluorophenyl)indole-3-acetamide and of other selective ligands of {TSPO}. Thus, the permeability transition is an inner membrane event that is regulated by the outer membrane through specific interactions with {TSPO}.},

	abstract = {The participation of reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) in the regulation of mitochondrial permeability transition pore ({mPTP}) opening by the redox-cycling compounds menadione and lucigenin was explored. The level of {ROS} was modulated by antioxidants, anoxia, and switching the sites of the reduction of redox cyclers, the dehydrogenases of the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes. We found that the reduction of both lucigenin and menadione in the outer mitochondrial membrane caused a strong production of {ROS}. However, {mPTP} opening was accelerated only in the presence of the cationic acceptor lucigenin. The antioxidants and scavengers of {ROS} that considerably decreased the level of {ROS} in mitochondria did not prevent or delay the {mPTP} opening. If the transmembrane potential under anoxia was supported by exogenous {ATP} or ferricyanide, the permeabilization of mitochondrial membranes by menadione or lucigenin was the same as under normoxia or even more pronounced. Under anoxia, the lucigenin-dependent permeabilization of membranes was less sensitive to {mPTP} antagonists than under normoxia. We conclude that the opening of the {mPTP} by redox cyclers may be independent of {ROS} and is due to the direct oxidation of mitochondrial pyridine nucleotides by menadione and the modification of critical thiols of the {mPTP} by the cation radical of lucigenin.},

In the present study we compared the rates of production of reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) and mitochondriotoxic effects of the redox-cycling lipophilic cationic dye lucigenin upon its activation by the respiratory chain and {NAD}(P)H-dependent oxidoreductases of the {OMM}. We found that, only in the presence of external {NADH} and {NADPH}, which are unable to penetrate the inner membrane, lucigenin stimulated a massive superoxide production and a fast permeabilization of mitochondrial membranes. The permeabilization was biphasic. The first, cyclosporin A-insensitive and Ca(2+)-independent phase was characterized by increased permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane to solutes with molecular masses of {\textless}or=200 Da. The second phase was sensitive to the antagonists of the permeability transition pore ({mPTP}) and was characterized by permeability similar to that of {mPTP} ({\textless}or=1500 Da). A massive cytochrome c release was observed even at the first phase of permeability when the second phase was inhibited by {mPTP} antagonists. Whatever the site of lucigenin activation, antioxidants and scavengers of {ROS} that strongly decrease the {ROS} level were unable to delay or prevent the permeabilization of membranes, which casts doubt on the involvement of {ROS} in the regulation of permeability by redox-cycling lipophilic cations. Our results strongly support the idea that the {NAD}(P)H-dependent reductases of xenobiotics of the {OMM} can mediate the toxicity of cationic dyes.},

	abstract = {{BH}3 (Bcl-2 homology 3)-only proteins of the Bcl-2 family activate Bax or Bak during apoptosis to promote the release of pro-death factors sequestered in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Previous results demonstrated that a synthetic {BH}3 peptide mimics the ability of the {BH}3-only protein Bid to promote Bax insertion and cytochrome c (cyt c) release from neural cell mitochondria. However, the {BH}3 peptide was deficient in promoting cyt c release from mitochondria without associated Bax, such as adult rat brain mitochondria. This study tested the hypothesis that the amphiphilic membrane-active cationic drugs dibucaine and propranolol block {BH}3 peptide-initiated cyt c efflux by preventing the integration of Bax into the mitochondrial outer membrane. {BH}3 peptide-initiated release of cyt c from {GT}1-7 neural cell mitochondria was inhibited by dibucaine and propranolol at concentrations of 100-300 microm. Recombinant Bax (100 nm) alone did not release cyt c from adult rat brain mitochondria; however, when {BH}3 peptide or caspase-8 cleaved Bid ({cBid}) was added, robust cyt c release was achieved that was inhibited completely by 200 microm dibucaine or propranolol. These drugs at similar concentrations also inhibited release of entrapped 10 {kDa} dextrans from protein-free liposomes treated with Bax and {cBid}. Contrary to the hypothesis that dibucaine and propranolol act by inhibiting the insertion of Bax into the mitochondrial outer membrane, membrane insertion of Bax was not inhibited in mitochondria or liposomes, indicating a mechanism of drug action downstream from this event. These results suggest that dibucaine and propranolol inhibit Bax-induced permeability changes through a direct interaction with the lipid membrane and present a novel target for the development of neuroprotective, antiapoptotic therapeutics.},

The mitochondrial permeability transition ({MPT}) pore - a protein complex that spans both the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes - is considered the mediator of this event and has been hypothesized to minimally consist of the voltage-dependent anion channel (Vdac) in the outer membrane, the adenine-nucleotide translocase (Ant) in the inner membrane and cyclophilin-D in the matrix. Here, we report the effects of deletion of the three mammalian Vdac genes on mitochondrial-dependent cell death. Mitochondria from Vdac1-, Vdac3-, and Vdac1-Vdac3-null mice exhibited a Ca(2+)- and oxidative stress-induced {MPT} that was indistinguishable from wild-type mitochondria. Similarly, Ca(2+)- and oxidative-stress-induced {MPT} and cell death was unaltered, or even exacerbated, in fibroblasts lacking Vdac1, Vdac2, Vdac3, Vdac1-Vdac3 and Vdac1-Vdac2-Vdac3. Wild-type and Vdac-deficient mitochondria and cells also exhibited equivalent cytochrome c release, caspase cleavage and cell death in response to the pro-death Bcl-2 family members Bax and Bid. These results indicate that Vdacs are dispensable for both {MPT} and Bcl-2 family member-driven cell death.},

When cells are deficient in both pro-apoptotic multidomain members of this family (Bax and Bak), mitochondrial membrane permeabilization does not occur in response to various apoptotic stimuli. We have previously reported that the voltage-dependent anion channel ({VDAC} or porin) plays a role in apoptotic mitochondrial membrane permeabilization by interacting with Bcl-2 family members. Here, we have provided additional evidence that {VDAC}2 is required for pro-apoptotic activity of Bax in the absence of Bak. In the absence of Bak, {VDAC}2-deficient cells showed strong resistance to various apoptotic stimuli, whereas re-introduction of the Vdac2 gene restored their apoptotic response. Consistently, silencing of {VDAC}2 in Bak-deficient cells, but not Bax-deficient cells, also conferred resistance to various apoptotic stimuli. In the absence of {VDAC}2 and Bak, the activation of Bax (assessed by mitochondrial membrane integration, conformational changes and oligomerization) was markedly impaired. Taken together, these findings indicate that {VDAC}2 is required for pro-apoptotic activity of Bax in the absence of Bak.},

	abstract = {Bcl-2 family members either promote or repress programmed cell death. Bax, a death-promoting member, is a pore-forming, mitochondria-associated protein whose mechanism of action is still unknown. During apoptosis, cytochrome C is released from the mitochondria into the cytosol where it binds to {APAF}-1, a mammalian homologue of Ced-4, and participates in the activation of caspases. The release of cytochrome C has been postulated to be a consequence of the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore ({PTP}). We now report that Bax is sufficient to trigger the release of cytochrome C from isolated mitochondria. This pathway is distinct from the previously described calcium-inducible, cyclosporin A-sensitive {PTP}. Rather, the cytochrome C release induced by Bax is facilitated by Mg2+ and cannot be blocked by {PTP} inhibitors. These results strongly suggest the existence of two distinct mechanisms leading to cytochrome C release: one stimulated by calcium and inhibited by cyclosporin A, the other Bax dependent, Mg2+ sensitive but cyclosporin insensitive.},

	abstract = {Ионы Са2+ играют важную роль в клеточной физиологии, так как служат сигналом, под действием которо-го клетки начинают выполнять свои запрограммированные функции. Са2+ особенно подходит для этой ро-ли благодаря своим химическим свойствам, а также потому, что градиент его концентрации между внекле-точным пространством и цитозолем очень велик (около четырех порядков). Концентрация Са2+ в клетке ре-гулируется связыванием с различными соединениями и транспортом через плазматическую и внутрикле-точные мембраны. Транспорт Са2+ обеспечивается различными каналами, транспортными АТРазами, уни-портерами и антипортерами в плазматической мембране, эндоплазматическом и саркоплазматическом ре-тикулуме и митохондриях. Регуляция этих транспортных систем - предмет возрастающего интереса многих исследователей. В этом обзоре мы сосредоточились на митохондриальных переносчиках, таких как кальци-евый унипортер, служащий для поглощения Са2+, и антипортерах, служащих для выхода катиона: Ca2+/Na+ антипортер митохондрий и плазматической мембраны возбудимых клеток, Са2+/{nН}+ антипортер печени и митохондрий других тканей. Митохондрии представляют особый интерес: в них Са2+ стимулирует дыхание и окислительное фосфорилирование, влияя тем самым на энергопотребление в активированных клетках. Исследования транспорта Са2+ в митохондриях начались в 50-х годах. Однако в конце 70-х годов интерес к обмену митохондриального Са2+ угас, так как стало ясно, что митохондрии в покоящихся клетках содержат очень мало Са2+. Интерес к проблеме снова возрос в 90-х годах, поскольку было обнаружено, что митохонд-рии и Са2+ играют важную роль в апоптозе и некрозе клеток. Это особенно выражено при кальциевой пе-регрузке и окислительном стрессе, приводящих к открытию в митохондриальной мембране поры с неспе-цифической проницаемостью},

	abstract = {Protein kinase M-ζ ({PKM}-ζ) is a constitutively active form of atypical protein kinase C that is exclusively expressed in the brain and implicated in the maintenance of long-term memory. Most studies that support a role for {PKM}-ζ in memory maintenance have used pharmacological {PKM}-ζ inhibitors such as the myristoylated zeta inhibitory peptide ({ZIP}) or chelerythrine. Here we use a genetic approach and target exon 9 of the Prkcz gene to generate mice that lack both protein kinase C-ζ ({PKC}-ζ) and {PKM}-ζ (Prkcz−/− mice). Prkcz−/− mice showed normal behaviour in a cage environment and in baseline tests of motor function and sensory perception, but displayed reduced anxiety-like behaviour. Notably, Prkcz−/− mice did not show deficits in learning or memory in tests of cued fear conditioning, novel object recognition, object location recognition, conditioned place preference for cocaine, or motor learning, when compared with wild-type littermates. {ZIP} injection into the nucleus accumbens reduced expression of cocaine-conditioned place preference in Prkcz−/− mice. In vitro, {ZIP} and scrambled {ZIP} inhibited {PKM}-ζ, {PKC}-ι and {PKC}-ζ with similar inhibition constant (Ki) values. Chelerythrine was a weak inhibitor of {PKM}-ζ (Ki = 76 μM). Our findings show that absence of {PKM}-ζ does not impair learning and memory in mice, and that {ZIP} can erase reward memory even when {PKM}-ζ is not present.},

	abstract = {In cultures of dissociated rat hippocampal neurons, persistent potentiation and depression of glutamatergic synapses were induced by correlated spiking of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. The relative timing between the presynaptic and postsynaptic spiking determined the direction and the extent of synaptic changes. Repetitive postsynaptic spiking within a time window of 20 msec after presynaptic activation resulted in long-term potentiation ({LTP}), whereas postsynaptic spiking within a window of 20 msec before the repetitive presynaptic activation led to long-term depression ({LTD}). Significant {LTP} occurred only at synapses with relatively low initial strength, whereas the extent of {LTD} did not show obvious dependence on the initial synaptic strength. Both {LTP} and {LTD} depended on the activation of {NMDA} receptors and were absent in cases in which the postsynaptic neurons were {GABAergic} in nature. Blockade of L-type calcium channels with nimodipine abolished the induction of {LTD} and reduced the extent of {LTP}. These results underscore the importance of precise spike timing, synaptic strength, and postsynaptic cell type in the activity-induced modification of central synapses and suggest that Hebb’s rule may need to incorporate a quantitative consideration of spike timing that reflects the narrow and asymmetric window for the induction of synaptic modification.},

	abstract = {In previous studies we showed that autonomous absence seizure generation and termination can be explained by realistic neuronal models eliciting bi-stable dynamics. In these models epileptic seizures are triggered either by external stimuli (reflex epilepsies) or by internal fluctuations. This scenario predicts exponential distributions of the duration of the seizures and of the inter-ictal intervals. These predictions were validated in rat models of absence epilepsy, as well as in a few human cases. Nonetheless, deviations from the predictions with respect to seizure duration distributions remained unexplained. The objective of the present work is to implement a simple but realistic computational model of a neuronal network including synaptic plasticity and ionic current dynamics and to explore the dynamics of the model with special emphasis on the distributions of seizure and inter-ictal period durations. We use as a basis our lumped model of cortical neuronal circuits. Here we introduce 'activity dependent' parameters, namely post-synaptic voltage-dependent plasticity, as well as a voltage-dependent hyperpolarization-activated current driven by slow and fast activation conductances. We examine the distributions of the durations of the seizure-like model activity and the normal activity, described respectively by the limit cycle and the steady state in the dynamics. We use a parametric γ-distribution fit as a quantifier. Our results show that autonomous, activity-dependent membrane processes can account for experimentally obtained statistical distributions of seizure durations, which were not explainable using the previous model. The activity-dependent membrane processes that display the strongest effect in accounting for these distributions are the hyperpolarization-dependent cationic (Ih) current and the {GABAa} plastic dynamics. Plastic synapses ({NMDA}-type) in the interneuron population show only a minor effect. The inter-ictal statistics retain their consistency with the experimental data and the previous model.},

Control of this conformational transition is important for brain function, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. {NMR} and fluorescence experiments now show that the Munc13-1 {MUN} domain, which plays a central role in vesicle priming, markedly accelerates the transition from the syntaxin-1–Munc18-1 complex to the {SNARE} complex. This activity depends on weak interactions of the {MUN} domain with the syntaxin-1 {SNARE} motif, and probably with Munc18-1. Together with available physiological data, these results provide a defined molecular basis for synaptic vesicle priming, and they illustrate how weak protein-protein interactions can play crucial biological roles by promoting transitions between high-affinity macromolecular assemblies.},

Recent work has demonstrated that this destabilizing influence is counteracted by a number of homeostatic plasticity mechanisms that stabilize neuronal activity. Such mechanisms include global changes in synaptic strengths, changes in neuronal excitability, and the regulation of synapse number. These recent studies suggest that Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity often target the same molecular substrates, and have opposing effects on synaptic or neuronal properties. These advances significantly broaden our framework for understanding the effects of activity on synaptic function and neuronal excitability.},

We propose that this feedback circuit provides the mechanism for the rhythmic suppression of interneuronal activity in the hippocampus, which is observed as low-level {GABAergic}-mediated theta activity. We also propose that this circuit may be the mechanism by which ascending brain stem pathways to the ms-{dbB}, in particular from the reticular formation, can influence hippocampal information processing in response to particular behavioral states, by exercising control over the level and frequency of theta activity in the hippocampus. In support of these proposals, we describe a minimal computational model of the feedback circuit which uses a set of four coupled differential equations describing the average dynamic activity of the populations of excitatory and inhibitory cells involved in the circuit. We demonstrate through simulations the inherently robust 4–6-Hz oscillatory dynamics of the circuit, and show that manipulation of internal connection strengths and external modulatory influences on this circuit changes the dynamics in a way which closely mimics corresponding manipulations in recent neurophysiological experiments investigating theta activity.

We have detected 6,600 phosphorylation sites on 2,244 proteins and have determined their temporal dynamics after stimulating {HeLa} cells with epidermal growth factor ({EGF}) and recorded them in the Phosida database. Fourteen percent of phosphorylation sites are modulated at least 2-fold by {EGF}, and these were classified by their temporal profiles. Surprisingly, a majority of proteins contain multiple phosphorylation sites showing different kinetics, suggesting that they serve as platforms for integrating signals. In addition to protein kinase cascades, the targets of reversible phosphorylation include ubiquitin ligases, guanine nucleotide exchange factors, and at least 46 different transcriptional regulators.

We discuss how membrane-cytoskeleton interactions are mediated and modulated, and how many proteins involved in these interactions are disrupted in human disease. We then highlight key molecular and physical variables that must be considered in order to mechanistically dissect events associated with changes in plasma membrane morphology. These considerations are integrated into the context of cell migration, filopodia formation, and clathrin-mediated endocytosis to show how a holistic view of the plasma membrane-cytoskeleton interface can allow for the appropriate interpretation of experimental findings and provide novel mechanistic insight into these important cellular events.},

The duration of the inhibition stabilized within a range of 30-60 msec. Many cells with single-spike background activity switched to generating post-inhibitory bursts at various levels of stimulation by current. Cells of the {MS}-{DB} with background rhythmical bursts always responded by phase locking to the stimulus.

	abstract = {The medial septum ({MS}) and nucleus of the diagonal band ({nDB}) are nuclei of the basal forebrain that contain both cholinergic and non-cholinergic neurons. Since the work of Green and Arduini (1954), it has been established that the {MS}/{nDB} form a crucial link between the brainstem reticular formation and the hippocampus. In order to understand the function of the basal forebrain component of this pathway, much research has been directed toward categorizing {MS}/{nDB} cell types physiologically, primarily with extracellular unit recording techniques in vivo. Experiments in anesthetized or curarized animals have distinguished three types of {MS}/{nDB} neurons based on spontaneous firing patterns (Apostol and Creutzfeldt, 1974; Lamour et al., 1984; Segal, 1974; Vinogradova et al., 1987). One neuron type fires in an irregular, single spike pattern. A second type of neuron fires in bursts of 2 to 10 spikes and the burst frequency is synchronized with hippocampal slow rhythmic activity (theta rhythms). These neurons may switch under certain conditions between irregular and burst-type firing patterns. In addition, antidromically activated septo-hippocampal neurons are more likely to be bursting neurons (50\%) than are unidentified {MS}/{nDB} neurons (30\%; Lamour et al., 1984). A third type of neuron reported by a few laboratories has a pacemaker-like firing pattern that does not convert to other patterns (Apostol and Creutzfeldt, 1974; Lamour et al., 1984; Vinogradova et al., 1987).},

	abstract = {The theta rhythm appears in the rat hippocampal electroencephalogram during exploration and shows phase locking to stimulus acquisition. Lesions that block theta rhythm impair performance in tasks requiring reversalofpriorlearning, {includingreversalinaT}-maze, whereassociations between one arm location and food reward need to be extinguished in favor of associations between the opposite arm location and food reward. Here, a hippocampal model shows how theta rhythm could be important for reversal in this task by providing separate functional phases during each 100-300 msec cycle, consistent with physiological data. In the model, effective encoding of new associations occurs in the phase when synaptic input from entorhinal cortex is strong and long-term potentiation ({LTP}) of excitatory connections arising from hippocampal region {CA}3 is strong, but synaptic currents arising from region {CA}3 input are weak (to prevent interference from prior learned associations). Retrieval of old associations occurs in the phase when entorhinal input is weak and synaptic input from region {CA}3 is strong, but when depotentiation occurs at synapses from {CA}3 (to allow extinction of prior learned associations that do not match current input). These phasic changes require that {LTP} at synapses arising from region {CA}3 should be strongest at the phase when synaptic transmission at these synapses is weakest. Consistent with these requirements, our recent data show that synaptic transmission in stratum radiatum is weakest at the positive peak of local theta, which is when previous data show that induction of {LTP} is strongest in this layer.},

	abstract = {A modulatory role for the hippocampal theta rhythm in synaptic plasticity is suggested by the observations that theta occurs during exploratory behaviors, spatial learning is impaired when the theta rhythm is disrupted, and excitation of hippocampal principal cells is phase-coupled to the theta wave. The theta phase affects the nature of the plasticity induced in urethane-anesthetized rats and in the carbachol-treated in vitro slice preparation, but these oscillations are phenomenologically different from natural theta, and the effects of theta phase on plasticity under natural conditions have not been reported. We therefore examined the effects of theta phase on the magnitude of long-term potentiation ({LTP}) in awake rats running on a linear track for a food reward. Twelve adult and 10 aged F344 male rats were implanted with a stimulating electrode in the perforant path and a recording electrode in the hilus of the fascia dentata. Stimuli were delivered at the peak or trough of the hilar theta rhythm. In both adult and aged, memory-impaired rats, {LTP} lasting at least 48 h was induced when stimuli were delivered at the positive theta peak, whereas {LTP} was not induced when stimuli were delivered at the negative troughs. Consistent with the finding that the threshold for {LTP} induction is increased at this synapse in old rats, the magnitude of {LTP} induced at the peak of theta rhythm was significantly lower in old animals. These data confirm that {LTP} can be modulated by locomotion-induced theta, and that this modulation is at least qualitatively preserved across age.

We have investigated the ability of brief bursts of {HFS} triggered at different phases of background theta rhythm to mimic more natural activity patterns. We show that a single burst of five pulses at 200 Hz given on the positive phase of tail pinch-triggered theta rhythm reliably induced {LTP} in the stratum radiatum of the hippocampus of urethane-anesthetized rats. Three of these bursts saturated {LTP}, and 10 bursts occluded the induction of {LTP} by long trains of {HFS}. Burst stimulation on the negative phase or at zero phase of theta did not induce {LTP} or long-term depression. In addition, stimulation with 10 bursts on the negative phase of theta reversed previously established {LTP}. The results show that the phase of sensory-evoked theta rhythm powerfully regulates the ability of brief {HFS} bursts to elicit either {LTP} or depotentiation of synaptic transmission. Furthermore, because complex spike activity of approximately five pulses on the positive phase of theta rhythm can be observed in freely moving rats, {LTP} induced by the present theta-triggered stimulation protocol might model putative synaptic plastic changes during learning more closely than standard {HFS}-induced {LTP}.},

	abstract = {A subset of {GABAergic} neurons projecting to the medial septum has long been described in the hippocampus. However, the lack of information about their local connectivity pattern or their correspondence with any of the well-established hippocampal interneuron types has hampered the understanding of their functional role. Retrograde tracing combined with immunostaining for neurochemical markers in the adult rat hippocampus showed that nearly all hippocampo-septal ({HS}) neurons express somatostatin ({\textgreater}95\%) and, in the hilus and {CA}3 stratum lucidum, many contain calretinin ({\textgreater}45\%). In contrast, in stratum oriens of the {CA}1 and {CA}3 subfields, the majority of {HS} neurons contain somatostatin ({\textgreater}86\%) and calbindin ({\textgreater}73\%), but not calretinin. Because somatostatin-positive hippocampal interneurons have been most extensively characterized in the stratum oriens of {CA}1, we focused our further analysis on {HS} cells found in this region. In 18–20-day-old rats, intracellularly filled {CA}1-{HS} cells had extensive local axon collaterals crossing subfield boundaries and innervating the {CA}3 region and the dentate gyrus. Electron microscopic analysis provided evidence that the axon terminals of {CA}1-{HS} cells form symmetrical synapses selectively on {GABAergic} interneurons, both locally and in the {CA}3 region. In addition, double retrograde labelling experiments revealed that many {CA}1-{HS} neurons of the dorsal hippocampus also have collateral projections to the ventral hippocampus. Thus, {CA}1-{HS} cells innervate inhibitory interneurons locally and in remote hippocampal regions, in addition to targeting mostly {GABAergic} neurons in the medial septum. This dual projection with striking target selectivity for {GABAergic} neurons may be ideally suited to synchronize neuronal activity along the septo-hippocampal axis.},

Computer simulations presented here demonstrate that phase deviations (timings) between inputs from the medial septum and the entorhinal cortex can create spatial patterns of theta-rhythm phase-locking. In this way, we show that the timing of inputs (not only their frequencies alone) can encode specific patterns of theta-rhythm activity.

	abstract = {Spike timing-dependent plasticity ({STDP}) and other conventional Hebbian-type plasticity rules are prone to produce runaway dynamics of synaptic weights. Once potentiated, a synapse would have higher probability to lead to spikes and thus to be further potentiated, but once depressed, a synapse would tend to be further depressed. The runaway synaptic dynamics can be prevented by precisely balancing {STDP} rules for potentiation and depression; however, experimental evidence shows a great variety of potentiation and depression windows and magnitudes. Here we show that modifications of synapses to layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons from rat visual and auditory cortices in slices can be induced by intracellular tetanization: bursts of postsynaptic spikes without presynaptic stimulation. Induction of these heterosynaptic changes depended on the rise of intracellular calcium, and their direction and magnitude correlated with initial state of release mechanisms. We suggest that this type of plasticity serves as a mechanism that stabilizes the distribution of synaptic weights and prevents their runaway dynamics. To test this hypothesis, we develop a cortical neuron model implementing both homosynaptic ({STDP}) and heterosynaptic plasticity with properties matching the experimental data. We find that heterosynaptic plasticity effectively prevented runaway dynamics for the tested range of {STDP} and input parameters. Synaptic weights, although shifted from the original, remained normally distributed and nonsaturated. Our study presents a biophysically constrained model of how the interaction of different forms of plasticity—Hebbian and heterosynaptic—may prevent runaway synaptic dynamics and keep synaptic weights unsaturated and thus capable of further plastic changes and formation of new memories.},

	abstract = {Theories on the functions of the hippocampal system are based largely on two fundamental discoveries: the amnestic consequences of removing the hippocampus and associated structures in the famous patient H.M. and the observation that spiking activity of hippocampal neurons is associated with the spatial position of the rat. In the footsteps of these discoveries, many attempts were made to reconcile these seemingly disparate functions. Here we propose that mechanisms of memory and planning have evolved from mechanisms of navigation in the physical world and hypothesize that the neuronal algorithms underlying navigation in real and mental space are fundamentally the same. We review experimental data in support of this hypothesis and discuss how specific firing patterns and oscillatory dynamics in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus can support both navigation and memory.

I discuss recent work suggesting that one function of theta is to package related information within individual theta cycles for more efficient spatial memory processing. Studies examining the role of theta phase precession in spatial memory, particularly sequence retrieval, are also summarized. Additionally, I discuss how interregional coupling of theta rhythms facilitates communication across brain regions.

Much of this experimental interest has been stimulated by suggestions that the mnemonic functions of the hippocampus may depend upon thetarelated neuronal activity. Inputs from the medial septal nuclei to the hippocampus were shown to be essential for the theta rhythm in the 1950s, but the role of these basal forebrain projections has not been clearly defined. Four models of the septo-hippocampal connections involved in theta rhythm production are reviewed as the precise roles of these projections are discussed. In our final, consolidated model both cholinergic and {GABAergic} septal projection cells fire in rhythmic bursts that entrain hippocampal interneurons. The resulting rhythmic inhibition of hippocampal projection cells, together with their excitatory interconnections, generates at least one component of the theta rhythm.},

	abstract = {Spontaneous and evoked neuronal activity of the medial septum-diagonal band complex was investigated extracellularly in slices, taken from the brain of the three groups of animals: hibernating ground squirrels, waking ground squirrels, and guinea-pigs. All slices were incubated at 31–32°C. The slices of the ground squirrels' brain were retested after keeping them for 15–36 h in the refrigerator at 2–4°C.
In all experimental groups the majority of the medial septum-diagonal band complex neurons had high regular or rhythmic burst spontaneous activity, which in half of the neuronal population persisted in conditions of synaptic blockade. The low-frequency irregular activity of the surrounding structures (lateral septum, caudate, accumbens, medial preoptic area) was completely suppressed in these conditions. The density of the spontaneously active neurons in the slices, as well as the mean frequency of discharges in the medial septum-diagonal band complex of hibernating ground squirrels, was significantly higher than that in waking ground squirrels and guinea-pigs.
Stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle evoked initial suppression of activity in majority of the medial septum-diagonal band complex units; in many of them the suppression was followed by a burst discharge. The neurons with background rhythmic burst activity always responded by resetting the spontaneous bursts. In total, about 50–60\% of the medial septum-diagonal band complex neurons of waking ground squirrels and guinea-pigs responded by post inhibitory bursts to the stimulation of medial forebrain bundle, while in hibernating ground squirrels such responses were observed in nearly all neurons. The threshold values of the stimulating current were significantly lower in the hibernating ground squirrels' group, the mean duration of the initial suppression was shorter, the intraburst density of spikes and/or duration of the bursts was increased. Thus, evaluation of spontaneous and evoked activity on the basis of various criteria revealed surprising similarity between the two groups of active animals, while the activity and excitability of the medial septum-diagonal band complex neurons was approximately doubled in the hibernating animals. This difference between active and hibernating ground squirrels was preserved during retesting after deep and prolonged cooling of the slices.
The experiments demonstrate paradoxical stable increase of activity and excitability of the medial septum-diagonal band complex neurons in the hibernating ground squirrels. The role of the medial septum in control of hibernation-euthermic waking cycle and possible relevance of this regulatory mechanism to sleep-waking cycle of homoiothermic animals is discussed.},

The two antigens were visualized either in the same sections using a double-label immunohistochemical procedure for the simultaneous localization of parvalbumin and choline acetyl-transferase, or in immediately adjacent sections. In double-stained sections of the whole medial septal-diagonal band complex, about 34\% of the total neurons showed immunoreactivity to parvalbumin; the proportion of parvalbumin-labelled neurons was slightly higher in the medial septal-vertical limb of the diagonal band region, and much lower in the horizontal limb of the diagonal band region. The distribution of parvalbumin- and choline acetyltransferase-containing neurons also varied markedly between different mediolateral subdivisions of the medial septum: about 30, 65 and 2\% of the parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons were present in the midline, medial and lateral part of the medial septum, respectively. At different rostrocaudal levels, the proportion of parvalbumin- and choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons varied in a consistent manner, and the largest number of parvalbumin-containing neurons was found at the level 1.9 mm anterior to the bregma.
In the absence of reliable immunocytochemical methods for the localization of glutamate decarboxylase and {GABA}, parvalbumin may serve as a good marker for studying the distribution of {GABAergic} neurons in the medial septum-diagonal band region. Moreover, the precise maps reported in the present study of the topographic localization of parvalbumin-containing {GABAergic} and choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive cholinergic nerve cells in the medial septal-diagonal band complex will serve as a useful guide in future morphological and electrophysiological studies on the septum and its efferents.},

	abstract = {Working memory ({WM}) is the ability to retain and associate information over brief time intervals. Functional imaging studies demonstrate that {WM} is mediated by a distributed network including frontal and posterior cortices, hippocampus, and cerebellum. In rodents, the presentation of stimuli in a {WM} task is followed by a reset of the phase of hippocampal theta. In this paper we report the observation of a similar phenomenon in normal human subjects. Neuromagnetic responses were recorded during presentation of a set of digits and a subsequent probe of the retained items. All stimuli were presented with a fixed temporal pattern. We observed phase reset of ≈7 Hz theta in left hippocampus ≈120 ms after probe stimuli, whereas reset of theta in right hippocampus was visible ≈80 ms prior to these anticipated stimuli. The duration of stimulus-locked theta increased with memory load, with a limiting value of ≈600 ms for 5–7 retained items. We suggest that, as in rats, stimulus-locked theta may index involvement of human hippocampal networks in the cognitive processing of sensory input. The anticipatory phase reset of theta indicates involvement of hippocampus in right hemisphere and cerebellar timing networks. Hippocampal structures are essential for orientation to perturbations in the sensory scene, a function that requires use of a context established by a constellation of stimuli. We suggest that the initiation and maintenance of stimulus-locked hippocampal theta observed here may facilitate processing of potentially salient and/or novel input with respect to a context established by the contents of {WM}.},

	abstract = {Electrical recordings from the surface of the skull have a wide range of rhythmic components. A major task of analysis of this {EEG} is to determine their source and functional significance. The hippocampal “theta rhythm” has been extensively studied in rats and its rhythmicity has recently been shown to be functionally significant, per se. Here, we use relevant aspects of the hippocampal literature to provide perspective on one of the most studied human {EEG} rhythms: frontal-midline theta. We review its electrographic features, localization, prevalence, age distribution, behavioural modulation (particularly in relation to working memory, spatial navigation, episodic memory, internalised attention and meditation), relationship to personality, drug interactions, neurochemical relationships, and coherence with rhythmic activity at other sites. We conclude that {FM}-theta, like hippocampal theta, appears to play a role in (or at least occur during) processing of memory and emotion. It is correlated with working memory and/or sustained attention; but this does not entail a role in function since clear behavioural correlates of hippocampal theta have been demonstrated that are not sensitive to hippocampal damage. {FM}-theta is increased by anxiolytic drug action and personality-related reductions in anxiety, whereas hippocampal theta is decreased by anxiolytic drugs. In animals, frontal theta and hippocampal theta can be phase-locked or independent, depending on behavioural state. So, the cognitive functions of {FM}-theta, and their relationship to hippocampal theta, are unclear and definitive evidence for functional involvement in cognitive or emotional processing is lacking. One possible solution to this problem is analysis of {FM}-theta in animals—provided homology can be determined. The issues of sporadicity and low incidence of {FM}-theta also need to be addressed in the future. Changes in functional connectivity, indicated by changes in coherence, are also a largely untapped resource. We suggest that the most hopeful path to assessing the functions of {FM}-theta will be through the use of drugs, and the variation of their effects depending on baseline levels of {FM}-theta. Finally, we review some theories of theta function. Despite the apparent richness of the current data, we conclude that it is difficult (and may ultimately be impossible) to formulate a theory that attributes a specific cognitive function to {FM}-theta. However, the theories share some general computational assumptions and these should be a useful guide to future work and, ultimately, a definite theory of the function or functions of {FM}-theta.},

The aim was to determine whether the {MSDB} is capable of generating and maintaining its own rhythmic firing activity, a mechanism by which it could impose a theta frequency oscillatory activity on the hippocampus. Bath application of 50–300 nm kainate to an in vitro preparation of 20- to 25-day-old rat {MSDB} elicited rhythmic extracellular field activity primarily within the theta frequency band (4–12 Hz). This activity was observed both at 33°C and at 37°C, and was localized to the midline part of the {MSDB} that is rich in parvalbumin-containing neurones. The application of neurotransmitter receptor antagonists and putative gap junction blockers showed that the oscillatory field activity was dependent upon the activation of {GABAA} receptors and possibly gap junctions, but not on the activation of {NMDA}, {GABAB}, muscarinic or nicotinic receptors. The frequency of the oscillatory activity was reduced by the application of diazepam or low doses of baclofen. Intracellular recording showed that concomitant action potential firing activity in putative {GABAergic} and cholinergic neurone populations was of a single spiking rather than a bursting firing nature, and was coherent with extracellularly recorded oscillatory field activity. We conclude that kainate activation of neuronal circuitry in the {MSDB} is capable of synchronization of rhythmic activity in the {MSDB}, and that this may underlie the mechanism for phase-locking rhythmic burst activity in the {MSDB} in vivo.},

The activity patterns of in vitro recorded theta-related cells were shown to be similar to those of theta-related cells recorded in vivo and cells recorded in vitro during cholinergically induced theta, and non-theta intervals were successfully classified according to previously developed criteria for in vivo recorded theta-related cells. The current in vitro experiments showed that, in addition to theta-on and theta-off cells, the {HPC} contained cells that were probably involved in programming the appearance and duration of theta epochs and the intervals between theta epochs. These novel types of cells were termed ’gating cells’.},

We used computer modeling to examine the function of these distal synaptic inputs, which led to three predictions that we confirmed in experiments using rat hippocampal slices. First, activation of {CA}1 neurons by the perforant path is limited, a result of the long distance between these inputs and the soma. Second, activation of {CA}1 neurons by the perforant path depends on the generation of dendritic spikes. Third, the forward propagation of these spikes is unreliable, but can be facilitated by modest activation of Schaffer-collateral synapses in the upper apical dendrites. This 'gating' of dendritic spike propagation may be an important activation mode of {CA}1 pyramidal neurons, and its modulation by neurotransmitters or long-term, activity-dependent plasticity may be an important feature of dendritic integration during mnemonic processing in the hippocampus.},

The aim of the document is to provide a framework for classifying and evaluating different models of plasticity. We focus on phenomenological synaptic models that are compatible with integrate-and-fire type neuron models where each neuron is described by a small number of variables. This implies that synaptic update rules for short-term or long-term plasticity can only depend on spike timing and, potentially, on membrane potential, as well as on the value of the synaptic weight, or on low-pass filtered (temporally averaged) versions of the above variables. We examine the ability of the models to account for experimental data and to fulfill expectations derived from theoretical considerations. We further discuss their relations to teacher-based rules (supervised learning) and reward-based rules (reinforcement learning). All models discussed in this paper are suitable for large-scale network simulations.},

Our model describes several nonlinear effects that are observed in {STDP} experiments, as well as the voltage dependence of plasticity. We found that, in a simulated recurrent network of spiking neurons, our plasticity rule led not only to development of localized receptive fields but also to connectivity patterns that reflect the neural code. For temporal coding procedures with spatio-temporal input correlations, strong connections were predominantly unidirectional, whereas they were bidirectional under rate-coded input with spatial correlations only. Thus, variable connectivity patterns in the brain could reflect different coding principles across brain areas; moreover, our simulations suggested that plasticity is fast.},

The spike timing-dependent plasticity ({STDP}) induction protocol of negative timing, with postsynaptic leading presynaptic stimulation of action potentials ({APs}), induced {LTD} as expected from the classical {STDP} rule. However, the positive {STDP} protocol of presynaptic leading postsynaptic stimulation of {APs} predominantly induced a presynaptically expressed {LTD} rather than the expected postsynaptically expressed {LTP}. Thus the induction of plasticity in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells does not obey the classical {STDP} rule for positive timing. This unusual {STDP} switched to a classical timing rule if the slow Ca2+-dependent, K+-mediated afterhyperpolarization ({sAHP}) was inhibited by the selective blocker N-trityl-3-pyridinemethanamine ({UCL}2077), by the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol, or by the cholinergic agonist carbachol. Thus we demonstrate that neuromodulators can affect synaptic plasticity by inhibition of the {sAHP}. These findings shed light on a fundamental question in the field of memory research regarding how environmental and behavioral stimuli influence {LTP}, thereby contributing to the modulation of memory.},

Here we show that {GABAergic} signaling governs the polarity of {STDP}, because blockade of {GABAA} receptors was able to completely reverse the temporal order of plasticity at corticostriatal synapses in rats and mice. {GABA} controls the polarity of {STDP} in both striatopallidal and striatonigral output neurons. Biophysical simulations and experimental investigations suggest that {GABA} controls {STDP} polarity through depolarizing effects at distal dendrites of striatal output neurons by modifying the balance of two calcium sources, {NMDARs} and voltage-sensitive calcium channels. These findings establish a central role for {GABAergic} circuits in shaping {STDP} and suggest that {GABA} could operate as a Hebbian/anti-Hebbian switch.},

Different types of {LTP} induction protocols differing in severity of stimulation can be distinguished in {CA}1 of the hippocampus. To better understand signaling mechanisms and involvement of neuromodulators such as dopamine ({DA}) in synaptic plasticity, less severe and more physiological low frequency induction protocols should be used. In the study which is reviewed here, critical determinants of spike timing-dependent plasticity ({STDP}) at hippocampal {CA}3-{CA}1 synapses were investigated. We found that {DA} via D1 receptor signaling, but not adrenergic signaling activated by the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, is important for successful expression of {STDP} at {CA}3-{CA}1 synapses. The {DA} effect on {STDP} is paralleled by changes in spike firing properties, thereby changing intrinsic excitability of postsynaptic {CA}1 neurons, and gating {STDP}. Whereas β-adrenergic signaling also leads to a similar (but not identical) regulation of firing pattern, it does not enable {STDP}. In this focused review we will discuss the current literature on dopaminergic modulation of {LTP} in {CA}1, with a special focus on timing dependent (t-){LTP}, and we will suggest possible reasons for the selective gating of {STDP} by {DA} [but not noradrenaline ({NA})] in {CA}1.},

For systems with sparse and inhibition-dominated recurrent connectivity, weak external inputs induced asynchronous irregular firing at low rates. Membrane potentials fluctuated a few millivolts below threshold, and membrane conductances were increased by a factor 2 to 5 with respect to the resting state. This combination of parameters characterizes the ongoing spiking activity typically recorded in the cortex in vivo. Many aspects of the asynchronous irregular state in conductance-based networks could be sufficiently well characterized with a simple numerical mean field approach. In particular, it correctly predicted an intriguing property of conductance-based networks that does not appear to be shared by current-based models: they exhibit states of low-rate asynchronous irregular activity that persist for some period of time even in the absence of external inputs and without cortical pacemakers. Simulations of larger networks (up to 350,000 neurons) demonstrated that the survival time of self-sustained activity increases exponentially with network size.},

Excitation and inhibition dynamically balance each other, with inhibition lagging excitation by only few milliseconds. To characterize the functional consequences of such correlated excitation and inhibition, we studied models in which this correlation structure is induced by feedforward inhibition ({FFI}). Simple circuits show that an effective {FFI} changes the integrative behavior of neurons such that only synchronous inputs can elicit spikes, causing the responses to be sparse and precise. Further, effective {FFI} increases the selectivity for propagation of synchrony through a feedforward network, thereby increasing the stability to background activity. Last, we show that recurrent random networks with effective inhibition are more likely to exhibit dynamical network activity states as have been observed in vivo. Thus, when a feedforward signal path is embedded in such recurrent network, the stabilizing effect of effective inhibition creates an suitable substrate for signal propagation. In conclusion, correlated excitation and inhibition support the notion that synchronous spiking may be important for cortical processing.},

To elucidate the underlying neural processes, we investigated a continuous network model for working memory of an analog feature. Our model network fundamentally operates with a shared resource mechanism, and stimuli in cue arrays are encoded by a distributed neural population. On the other hand, the network dynamics and performance are also consistent with the discrete-slot model, because multiple objects are maintained by distinct localized population persistent activity patterns (bump attractors). We identified two phenomena of recurrent circuit dynamics that give rise to limited working memory capacity. As the working memory load increases, a localized persistent activity bump may either fade out (so the memory of the corresponding item is lost) or merge with another nearby bump (hence the resolution of mnemonic representation for the merged items becomes blurred). We identified specific dependences of these two phenomena on the strength and tuning of recurrent synaptic excitation, as well as network normalization: the overall population activity is invariant to set size and delay duration; therefore, a constant neural resource is shared by and dynamically allocated to the memorized items. We demonstrate that the model reproduces salient observations predicted by both discrete-slot and shared-resource models, and propose testable predictions of the merging phenomenon.},

	abstract = {Stochastic resonance ({SR}) has been shown to enhance the signal to noise ratio or detection of signals in neurons. It is not yet clear how this effect of {SR} on the signal to noise ratio affects signal processing in neural networks. In this paper, we investigate the effects of the location of background noise input on information transmission in a hippocampal {CA}1 neuron model. In the computer simulation, random sub-threshold spike trains (signal) generated by a filtered homogeneous Poisson process were presented repeatedly to the middle point of the main apical branch, while the homogeneous Poisson shot noise (background noise) was applied to a location of the dendrite in the hippocampal {CA}1 model consisting of the soma with a sodium, a calcium, and five potassium channels. The location of the background noise input was varied along the dendrites to investigate the effects of background noise input location on information transmission. The computer simulation results show that the information rate reached a maximum value for an optimal amplitude of the background noise amplitude. It is also shown that this optimal amplitude of the background noise is independent of the distance between the soma and the noise input location. The results also show that the location of the background noise input does not significantly affect the maximum values of the information rates generated by stochastic resonance.},

We assembled our model to simulate spatial alternation, a task that requires memory of the previous path through the environment for correct selection of the current path to a reward site. The convergence of inputs from entorhinal cortex and hippocampal region {CA}3 onto {CA}1 pyramidal cells make them potentially important for integrating information about place and temporal context on the network level.

The existence of these distinct types of information calls for some means by which they can be managed in an appropriate way, by integrating them or keeping them separate as required to improve recognition. We hypothesize that several anatomical features of the hippocampus, including differentiation in connectivity between the superior/inferior blades of {DG} and the distal/proximal regions of {CA}3 and {CA}1, work together to play this information managing role. We construct a set of neural network models with these features and compare their recognition performance when given noisy or partial versions of contexts and their associated objects. We found that the anterior and posterior regions of the hippocampus naturally require different ratios of object and context input for optimal performance, due to the greater number of objects versus contexts. Additionally, we found that having separate processing regions in {DG} significantly aided recognition in situations where object inputs were degraded. However, split processing in both {DG} and {CA}3 resulted in performance tradeoffs, though the actual hippocampus may have ways of mitigating such losses.},

Furthermore, {NMDAR}-mediated {AMPAR} trafficking is regulated by {PKA} and accompanied by dephosphorylation and rephosphorylation of {GluR}1 subunits at a {PKA} site. In contrast, activation of {AMPARs} without {NMDAR} activation targets {AMPARs} to late endosomes and lysosomes, independent of Ca2+, protein phosphatases, or {PKA}.

In a saturating concentration of agonist, each of these {AMPAR}/{TARP} combinations gave rise to single-channel currents with multiple conductance levels that appeared intrinsic to the receptor-channel complex, and showed long-lived subconductance states. The open time and burst length distributions of the receptor complexes displayed multiple dwell-time components. In the case of γ-2- and γ-4-associated receptors, these distributions included a long-lived component lasting tens of milliseconds that was absent from both {GluA}1 alone and γ-5-associated receptors. The open time distributions for each conductance level required two dwell-time components, indicating that at each conductance level the channel occupies a minimum of two kinetically distinct open states.

	abstract = {We performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in vitro to investigate the integration of excitatory and inhibitory inputs in neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei ({DCN}) by applying synthetic synaptic input patterns with dynamic clamping. We explored an input regime in which excitation and inhibition had an ongoing baseline rate because both input pathways show ongoing activity in vivo. We found that spiking was time-locked to transients in the inputs, consisting of brief decreases in inhibitory or increases in excitatory conductance. Such input transients were caused by synchronization among multiple inputs. However, we found that temporal synchrony in the inhibitory input pathway had preferential access to the control of {DCN} spiking, because the large {NMDA} component of the excitatory inputs smoothed out temporal transients in this pathway. Thus, synaptic integration in the {DCN} appears to be tuned to allow the cerebellar cortical output from Purkinje cells preferential access to the control of {DCN} spiking. The effect of temporal modulations in the inhibition was further enhanced by the voltage dependence of the {NMDA} inputs. Thus, the presence of a baseline of mossy and climbing fiber inputs boosted depolarizing responses caused by reduced inhibition by the voltage-dependent increase in inward {NMDA} current. Overall, our results show that correlated activity or pauses in populations of Purkinje cells are well suited to the dynamic control of {DCN} spiking. In addition, strong transients in excitation can directly drive {DCN} responses that bypass cerebellar cortical processing.},

Synaptic plasticity confers environmental adaptability through modification of the connectivity between neurons and neuronal circuits. This is achieved through changes to synapse-associated signaling systems and supported by complementary changes to cellular morphology and metabolism within the tripartite synapse. Mounting evidence suggests region-specific changes to synaptic form and function occur as a result of chronic stress and in depression. Within subregions of the prefrontal cortex ({PFC}) and hippocampus structural and synapse-related findings seem consistent with a deficit in long-term potentiation ({LTP}) and facilitation of long-term depression ({LTD}), particularly at excitatory pyramidal synapses. Other brain regions are less well-studied; however the amygdala may feature a somewhat opposite synaptic pathology including reduced inhibitory tone. Changes to synaptic plasticity in stress and depression may correlate those to several signal transduction pathways (e.g. {NOS}-{NO}, {cAMP}-{PKA}, Ras-{ERK}, {PI}3K-Akt, {GSK}-3, {mTOR} and {CREB}) and upstream receptors (e.g. {NMDAR}, {TrkB} and p75NTR). Deficits in synaptic plasticity may further correlate disrupted brain redox and bioenergetics. Finally, at a functional level region-specific changes to synaptic plasticity in depression may relate to maladapted neurocircuitry and parallel reduced cognitive control over negative emotion.},

	abstract = {Strengthening of synaptic connections following coincident pre- and postsynaptic activity was proposed by Hebb as a cellular mechanism for learning. Contemporary models assume that multiple synapses must act cooperatively to induce the postsynaptic activity required for hebbian synaptic plasticity. One mechanism for the implementation of this cooperation is action potential firing, which begins in the axon, but which can influence synaptic potentiation following active backpropagation into dendrites. Backpropagation is limited, however, and action potentials often fail to invade the most distal dendrites. Here we show that long-term potentiation of synapses on the distal dendrites of hippocampal {CA}1 pyramidal neurons does require cooperative synaptic inputs, but does not require axonal action potential firing and backpropagation. Rather, locally generated and spatially restricted regenerative potentials (dendritic spikes) contribute to the postsynaptic depolarization and calcium entry necessary to trigger potentiation of distal synapses. We find that this mechanism can also function at proximal synapses, suggesting that dendritic spikes participate generally in a form of synaptic potentiation that does not require postsynaptic action potential firing in the axon.},

	abstract = {Spike-timing-dependent plasticity ({STDP}) provides a cellular implementation of the Hebb postulate, which states that synapses, whose activity repeatedly drives action potential firing in target cells, are potentiated. At glutamatergic synapses onto hippocampal and neocortical pyramidal cells, synaptic activation followed by spike firing in the target cell causes long-term potentiation ({LTP})—as predicted by Hebb—whereas excitatory postsynaptic potentials ({EPSPs}) evoked after a spike elicit long-term depression ({LTD})—a phenomenon that was not specifically addressed by Hebb. In both instances the action potential in the postsynaptic target neuron is an instructive signal that is capable of supporting synaptic plasticity. {STDP} generally relies on the propagation of Na+ action potentials that are initiated in the axon hillhock back into the dendrite, where they cause depolarization and boost local calcium influx. However, recent studies in {CA}1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons have suggested that local calcium spikes might provide a more efficient trigger for {LTP} induction than backpropagating action potentials. Dendritic calcium spikes also play a role in an entirely different type of {STDP} that can be observed in cerebellar Purkinje cells. These neurons lack backpropagating Na+ spikes. Instead, plasticity at parallel fiber ({PF}) to Purkinje cell synapses depends on the relative timing of {PF}-{EPSPs} and activation of the glutamatergic climbing fiber ({CF}) input that causes dendritic calcium spikes. Thus, the instructive signal in this system is externalized. Importantly when {EPSPs} are elicited before {CF} activity, {PF}-{LTD} is induced rather than {LTP}. Thus, {STDP} in the cerebellum follows a timing rule that is opposite to its hippocampal/neocortical counterparts. Regardless, a common motif in plasticity is that {LTD}/{LTP} induction depends on the relative timing of synaptic activity and regenerative dendritic spikes which are driven by the instructive signal.},

Here, we identify actions of cholinergic signaling on cellular and synaptic properties of neurons in several brain areas and discuss consequences of this signaling on behaviors related to drug abuse, attention, food intake, and affect. The diverse effects of acetylcholine depend on site of release, receptor subtypes, and target neuronal population; however, a common theme is that acetylcholine potentiates behaviors that are adaptive to environmental stimuli and decreases responses to ongoing stimuli that do not require immediate action. The ability of acetylcholine to coordinate the response of neuronal networks in many brain areas makes cholinergic modulation an essential mechanism underlying complex behaviors.},

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor ({BDNF}) is an important regulator of synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation ({LTP}) in the hippocampus and in other brain regions, playing a role in the formation of certain forms of memory. The effects of {BDNF} in {LTP} are mediated by {TrkB} (tropomyosin-related kinase B) receptors, which are known to be coupled to the activation of the Ras/{ERK}, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and phospholipase C-γ ({PLC}-γ) pathways. The role of {BDNF} in {LTP} is best studied in the hippocampus, where the neurotrophin acts at pre- and post-synaptic levels. Recent studies have shown that {BDNF} regulates the transport of {mRNAs} along dendrites and their translation at the synapse, by modulating the initiation and elongation phases of protein synthesis, and by acting on specific {miRNAs}. Furthermore, the effect of {BDNF} on transcription regulation may further contribute to long-term changes in the synaptic proteome. In this review we discuss the recent progress in understanding the mechanisms contributing to the short- and long-term regulation of the synaptic proteome by {BDNF}, and the role in synaptic plasticity, which is likely to influence learning and memory formation.

	abstract = {1. A model of the electrophysiological properties of single thalamocortical relay neurons in the rodent and cat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus was constructed, based in part on the voltage dependence and kinetics of ionic currents detailed with voltage-clamp techniques. The model made the simplifying assumption of a single uniform compartment and incorporated a fast and transient Na+ current, {INa}; a persistent, depolarization-activated Na+ current, {INap}; a low-threshold Ca2+ current, I(T); a high-threshold Ca2+ current, {IL}; a Ca(2+)-activated K+ current, {IC}; a transient and depolarization-activated K+ current, {IA}; a slowly inactivating and depolarization-activated K+ current, {IK}2; a hyperpolarization-activated cation current, Ih; and K+ and Na+ leak currents {IKleak} and {INaleak}. 2. The effects of the various ionic currents on the electrophysiological properties of thalamocortical relay neurons were initially investigated through examining the effect of each current individually on passive membrane responses. The two leak currents, {IKleak} and {INaleak}, determined in large part the resting membrane potential and the apparent input resistance of the model neuron. Addition of {IA} resulted in a delay in the response of the model cell to a depolarizing current pulse, whereas addition of {IK}2, or {IL} combined with {IC}, resulted in a marked and prolonged decrease in the response to depolarization. Addition of Ih resulted in a depolarizing "sag" in response to hyperpolarization, whereas addition of {IT} resulted in a large rebound Ca2+ spike after hyperpolarization. Finally, addition of {INap} resulted in enhancement of depolarization. 3. The low-threshold Ca2+ spike of rodent neurons was successfully modeled with the active currents I(T), {IL}, {IA}, {IC}, and {IK}2. The low-threshold Ca2+ current I(T) generated the low-threshold Ca2+ spike. The transient K+ current {IA} slowed the rate of rise and reduced the peak amplitude of the low-threshold Ca2+ spike, whereas the slowly inactivating K+ current {IK}2 contributed greatly to the repolarization of the Ca2+ spike. Activation of {IL} during the peak of the Ca2+ spike led to activation of {IC}, which also contributed to the repolarization of the Ca2+ spike. Reduction of any one of the K+ currents resulted in an increase in the other two, thereby resulting in substantially smaller changes in the Ca2+ spike than would be expected on the basis of the amplitude of each ionic current alone.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

These mechanisms have been shown to be important for virtually all stages of assembling a neural network, from neurite guidance, branching, and growth to synapse morphogenesis and function. From the moment a gene is transcribed, it undergoes a series of post-transcriptional regulatory modifications in the nucleus and cytoplasm until its final deployment as a functional protein. Initially, a message is subjected to extensive structural regulation through alternative splicing, which is capable of greatly expanding the protein repertoire by generating, in some cases, thousands of functionally distinct isoforms from a single gene locus. Then, {RNA} packaging into neuronal transport granules and recognition by {RNA}-binding proteins and/or {microRNAs} is capable of restricting protein synthesis to selective locations and under specific input conditions. This ability of the post-transcriptional apparatus to expand the informational content of a cell and control the deployment of proteins in both spatial and temporal dimensions is a feature well adapted for the extreme morphological properties of neural cells. In this review, we describe recent advances in understanding how post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms refine the proteomic complexity required for the assembly of intricate and specific neural networks.},

A mutation in the cytoplasmic domain of {VAMP}2 that inhibits endocytosis abolished its axonal polarization. In contrast, the targeting of {NgCAM} depends on sequences in its ectodomain, which mediate its sorting into carriers that preferentially deliver their cargo proteins to the axonal membrane.

	abstract = {Neural network simulators that take into account the spiking behavior of neurons are useful for studying brain mechanisms and for various neural engineering applications. Spiking Neural Network ({SNN}) simulators have been traditionally simulated on large-scale clusters, super-computers, or on dedicated hardware architectures. Alternatively, Compute Unified Device Architecture ({CUDA}) Graphics Processing Units ({GPUs}) can provide a low-cost, programmable, and high-performance computing platform for simulation of {SNNs}. In this paper we demonstrate an efficient, biologically realistic, large-scale {SNN} simulator that runs on a single {GPU}. The {SNN} model includes Izhikevich spiking neurons, detailed models of synaptic plasticity and variable axonal delay. We allow user-defined configuration of the {GPU}-{SNN} model by means of a high-level programming interface written in C++ but similar to the {PyNN} programming interface specification. {PyNN} is a common programming interface developed by the neuronal simulation community to allow a single script to run on various simulators. The {GPU} implementation (on {NVIDIA} {GTX}-280 with 1 {GB} of memory) is up to 26 times faster than a {CPU} version for the simulation of 100K neurons with 50 Million synaptic connections, firing at an average rate of 7 Hz. For simulation of 10 Million synaptic connections and 100K neurons, the {GPU} {SNN} model is only 1.5 times slower than real-time. Further, we present a collection of new techniques related to parallelism extraction, mapping of irregular communication, and network representation for effective simulation of {SNNs} on {GPUs}. The fidelity of the simulation results was validated on {CPU} simulations using firing rate, synaptic weight distribution, and inter-spike interval analysis. Our simulator is publicly available to the modeling community so that researchers will have easy access to large-scale {SNN} simulations.},

Adenosine receptors play a major role in presynaptic neuromodulation, while P2X ionotropic receptors are involved in fast synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. P2Y G protein-coupled receptors are largely involved in presynaptic activities, as well as mediating long-term (trophic) signalling in cell proliferation, differentiation and death during development and regeneration. Both P1 and P2 receptors participate in neuron-glial interactions. Purinergic signalling is involved in control of cerebral vascular tone and remodelling and has been implicated in learning and memory, locomotor and feeding behaviour and sleep. There is increasing interest in the involvement of purinergic signalling in the pathophysiology of the {CNS}, including trauma, ischaemia, epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases, neuropsychiatric and mood disorders, and cancer, including gliomas.},

	abstract = {{ATP} and norepinephrine ({NE}) are cotransmitters released from many postganglionic sympathetic nerves. In this article, we review the evidence for {ATP} and {NE} cotransmission in the rodent vas deferens with special attention to the mechanisms involved in removing the cotransmitters from the neuroeffector junction. Although the clearance of {NE} is well understood (e.g., the primary mechanism being reuptake into the nerves), the clearance of {ATP} is just beginning to be explained. The general belief has been that {ATP} is metabolized by cell-fixed ecto-nucleotidases. It now seems, however, that when {ATP} is released from nerves as a transmitter there is a concomitant release of nucleotidases that rapidly degrade {ATP} sequentially to {ADP}, {AMP}, and adenosine, thereby terminating the action of {ATP}. In the guinea pig vas deferens, there appear to be at least two enzymes, one that converts {ATP} to {ADP} and {ADP} to {AMP} (an {ATPDase}) and a second enzyme that converts {AMP} to adenosine (an {AMPase}). An important feature of this process is that the transmitter-metabolizing nucleotidases are released into the synaptic space as opposed to being fixed to cell membranes. A preliminary characterization of these enzymes suggests that the releasable {ATPDase} exhibits some similarities to known ectonucleoside triphosphate/diphosphohydrolases, whereas the releasable {AMPase} exhibits some similarities to ecto-5′-nucleotidases.},

	abstract = {In the progress of science, as in life, timing is important. The acidic dipeptide, N-acetylaspartylglutamate ({NAAG}), was discovered in the mammalian nervous system in 1965, but initially was not considered to be a neurotransmitter candidate. In the mid-1980s, a few laboratories revisited the question of {NAAG}'s role in the nervous system and pursued hypotheses regarding its function that ranged from a precursor for the transmitter pool of glutamate to a direct role as a peptide transmitter. Since that time, {NAAG} has been tested against nearly all of the established criteria for identification of a neurotransmitter. It successfully meets each of these tests, including a concentrated presence in neurons and synaptic vesicles, release from axon endings in a calcium-dependent manner following initiation of action potentials, and extracellular hydrolysis by membrane-bound peptidase activity. {NAAG} is the most prevalent and widely distributed neuropeptide in the mammalian nervous system. {NAAG} activates {NMDA} receptors with a low potency that may vary among receptor subtypes, and it is a highly selective agonist at the type 3 metabotropic glutamate receptor ({mGluR}3). Acting through this receptor, {NAAG} reduces cyclic {AMP} levels, decreases voltage-dependent calcium conductance, suppresses excitotoxicity, influences long-term potentiation and depression, regulates {GABAA} receptor subunit expression, and inhibits synaptic release of {GABA} from cortical neurons. Cloning of peptidase activities against {NAAG} provides opportunities to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which synaptic {NAAG} peptidase activity is controlled. Given the codistribution of this peptide with a spectrum of traditional transmitters and its ability to activate {mGluR}3, we speculate that one role for {NAAG} following synaptic release is the activation of metabotropic autoreceptors that inhibit subsequent transmitter release. A second role is the production of extracellular glutamate following {NAAG} hydrolysis.},

Expression of the appropriate neurotransmitters is essential for the function of neural circuits. Can neurons change their transmitter phenotype to deal with alterations in the environment? Dulcis et al. (p. 449; see the Perspective by Birren and Marder) exposed adult rats to different photoperiods mimicking summer and winter daylengths. Neurotransmitter expression switched between dopamine and somatostatin in hypothalamic neurons that regulate release of corticotropin-releasing factor. Transmitter switching occurred at the transcriptional level and was accompanied by changes in postsynaptic receptors.
Neurotransmitters have been thought to be fixed throughout life, but whether sensory stimuli alter behaviorally relevant transmitter expression in the mature brain is unknown. We found that populations of interneurons in the adult rat hypothalamus switched between dopamine and somatostatin expression in response to exposure to short- and long-day photoperiods. Changes in postsynaptic dopamine receptor expression matched changes in presynaptic dopamine, whereas somatostatin receptor expression remained constant. Pharmacological blockade or ablation of these dopaminergic neurons led to anxious and depressed behavior, phenocopying performance after exposure to the long-day photoperiod. Induction of newly dopaminergic neurons through exposure to the short-day photoperiod rescued the behavioral consequences of lesions. Natural stimulation of other sensory modalities may cause changes in transmitter expression that regulate different behaviors.},

Here, we show that a cell-permeable, biotinylated pan-caspase inhibitor ({bVAD}-fmk) both inhibited and 'trapped' the apical caspase activated when apoptosis was triggered. As expected, only caspase-8 was trapped in response to ligation of death receptors, whereas only caspase-9 was trapped in response to a variety of other apoptosis-inducing agents. Caspase-2 was exclusively activated in heat shock-induced apoptosis. This activation of caspase-2 was also observed in cells protected from heat-shock-induced apoptosis by Bcl-2 or Bcl-{xL}. Reduced sensitivity to heat-shock-induced death was observed in caspase-2(-/-) cells. Furthermore, cells lacking the adapter molecule {RAIDD} failed to activate caspase-2 after heat shock treatment and showed resistance to apoptosis in this setting. This approach unambiguously identifies the apical caspase activated in response to apoptotic stimuli, and establishes caspase-2 as a proximal mediator of heat shock-induced apoptosis.},

	abstract = {Cytotoxic T lymphocytes ({CTL}) can trigger an apoptotic signal through the Fas receptor or by the exocytosis of granzyme B and perforin. Caspase activation is an important component of both pathways. Granzyme B, a serine proteinase contained in granules, has been shown to proteolytically process and activate members of the caspase family in vitro. In order to gain an understanding of the contributions of caspases 8 and 3 during granule-induced apoptosis in intact cells, we have used target cells that either stably express the rabbitpox virus-encoded caspase inhibitor {SPI}-2 or are devoid of caspase 3. The overexpression of {SPI}-2 in target cells significantly inhibited {DNA} fragmentation, phosphatidylserine externalization, and mitochondrial disruption during Fas-mediated cell death. In contrast, {SPI}-2 expression in target cells provided no protection against granzyme-mediated apoptosis, mitochondrial collapse, or cytolysis, leading us to conclude that {SPI}-2-inhibited caspases are not an essential requirement for the granzyme pathway. Caspase 3-deficient {MCF}-7 cells were found to be resistant to {CTL}-mediated {DNA} fragmentation but not to {CTL}-mediated cytolysis and loss of the mitochondrial inner membrane potential. Furthermore, we demonstrate that granzyme B directly cleaves the proapoptotic molecule Bid, bypassing the need for caspase 8 activation of Bid. These results provide evidence for a two-pronged strategy for mediating target cell destruction and provide evidence of a direct link between granzyme B activity, Bid cleavage, and caspase 3 activation in whole cells.},

We show here that cytochrome c release requires the direct proteolytic cleavage of Bid by {grB} to generate a 14-{kD} {grB}-truncated product ({gtBid}) that translocates to mitochondria. In turn, {gtBid} recruits Bax to mitochondria through a caspase-independent mechanism where it becomes integrated into the membrane and induces cytochrome c release.

Caspase-2 promoted cytochrome c release from mitochondria in the presence of cytosol from wild-type, but not Bid-deficient, mouse embryonic fibroblasts ({MEFs}). Recombinant wild-type Bid, but not a noncleavable mutant (D59E), restored cytochrome c release. Similarly, Bid-null {MEFs} were relatively resistant to apoptosis triggered by active Caspase-2, and apoptosis was restored in Bid-null cells by the expression of wild-type, but not D59E, Bid. Finally, Bid-null {MEFs} were substantially more resistant to apoptosis induced by heat shock, which has been shown to be dependent on apical activation of Caspase-2. The data are consistent with a model in which Caspase-2 induces apoptosis via cleavage of Bid at D59 and the subsequent engagement of the mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway.},

	abstract = {Author Summary
Even in the absence of external sensory cues, foraging rodents maintain an
estimate of their position, allowing them to return home in a roughly straight
line. This computation is known as dead reckoning or path integration. A
discovery made three years ago in rats focused attention on the dorsolateral
medial entorhinal cortex ({dMEC}) as a location in the rat's brain where
this computation might be performed. In this area, so-called grid cells fire
whenever the rat is on any vertex of a triangular grid that tiles the plane.
Here we propose a model that could generate grid-cell-like responses in a neural
network. The inputs to the model network convey information about the
rat's velocity and heading, consistent with known inputs projecting
into the {dMEC}. The network effectively integrates these inputs to produce a
response that depends on the rat's absolute position. We show that such
a neural network can integrate position accurately and can reproduce
grid-cell-like responses similar to those observed experimentally. We then
suggest a set of experiments that could help identify whether our suggested
mechanism is responsible for the emergence of grid cells and for path
integration in the rat's brain.},

	abstract = {The spatial responses of many of the cells recorded in all layers of rodent medial entorhinal cortex ({mEC}) show mutually aligned grid patterns. Recent experimental findings have shown that grids can often be better described as elliptical rather than purely circular and that, beyond the mutual alignment of their grid axes, ellipses tend to also orient their long axis along preferred directions. Are grid alignment and ellipse orientation aspects of the same phenomenon? Does the grid alignment result from single-unit mechanisms or does it require network interactions? We address these issues by refining a single-unit adaptation model of grid formation, to describe specifically the spontaneous emergence of conjunctive grid-by-head-direction cells in layers {III}, V, and {VI} of {mEC}. We find that tight alignment can be produced by recurrent collateral interactions, but this requires head-direction ({HD}) modulation. Through a competitive learning process driven by spatial inputs, grid fields then form already aligned, and with randomly distributed spatial phases. In addition, we find that the self-organization process is influenced by any anisotropy in the behavior of the simulated rat. The common grid alignment often orients along preferred running directions ({RDs}), as induced in a square environment. When speed anisotropy is present in exploration behavior, the shape of individual grids is distorted toward an ellipsoid arrangement. Speed anisotropy orients the long ellipse axis along the fast direction. Speed anisotropy on its own also tends to align grids, even without collaterals, but the alignment is seen to be loose. Finally, the alignment of spatial grid fields in multiple environments shows that the network expresses the same set of grid fields across environments, modulo a coherent rotation and translation. Thus, an efficient metric encoding of space may emerge through spontaneous pattern formation at the single-unit level, but it is coherent, hence context-invariant, if aided by collateral interactions.},

In this study, we model the differentiation between grid and conjunctive cells in a network with self-organized connections. Arranged into distinct “layers”, the model grid units and conjunctive units develop, with a similar time course, grid fields resulting from firing rate adaptation and competitive learning. Grid alignment in both layers is delayed with respect to the formation of triangular grids. A common grid orientation among conjunctive units is produced, in the model, by head-direction modulated collateral interactions, while the grids of grid units inherit the same orientation through connections from conjunctive units. Grid units as well as conjunctive units share a similar spacing but show a random distribution of spatial phases. Grid units however carry more spatial information than conjunctive units, thus providing better inputs for the hippocampus to form spatial memories. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The model incorporates network architecture derived from earlier attractor map models, and is implemented in 1D for simplicity. Periodic driving of conjunctive (position × head-direction) layer-{III} {MEC} cells at theta frequency with intensity proportional to the rat's speed, moves an ‘activity bump’ forward in network space at a corresponding speed. The addition of prolonged excitatory currents and simple after-spike dynamics resembling those observed in {MEC} stellate cells (for which new data are presented) accounts for both phase precession and the change in scale of grid fields along the dorso-ventral axis of {MEC}. Phase precession in the model depends on both synaptic connectivity and intrinsic currents, each of which drive neural spiking either during entry into, or during exit out of a grid field. Thus, the model predicts that the slope of phase precession changes between entry into and exit out of the field. The model also exhibits independent variation in grid spatial period and grid field size, which suggests possible experimental tests of the model. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

This paper describes a model that combines elements of two major classes of models of grid cells: models using interactions of oscillations and models using attractor dynamics. This model includes a population of units with oscillatory input representing input from the medial septum. These units are termed heading angle cells because their connectivity depends upon heading angle in the environment as well as the spatial phase coded by the cell. These cells project to a population of grid cells. The sum of the heading angle input results in standing waves of circularly symmetric input to the grid cell population. Feedback from the grid cell population increases the activity of subsets of the heading angle cells, resulting in the network settling into activity patterns that resemble the patterns of firing fields in a population of grid cells. The properties of heading angle cells firing as conjunctive grid-by-head-direction cells can shift the grid cell firing according to movement velocity. The pattern of interaction of oscillations requires use of separate populations that fire on alternate cycles of the net theta rhythmic input to grid cells.},

However, experimental evidence supporting the presence of such connectivity among grid cells in layer {II} is limited. Here we report recordings from more than 600 neuron pairs in rat entorhinal slices, demonstrating that stellate cells, the principal cell type in the layer {II} grid network, are mainly interconnected via inhibitory interneurons.

In layer {III}, V and {VI} of the rat {MEC}, grid cells are also selective to head-direction and are modulated by the speed of the animal. Several putative mechanisms of grid-like maps were proposed, including attractor network dynamics, interactions with theta oscillations or single-unit mechanisms such as firing rate adaptation. In this paper, we present a new attractor network model that accounts for the conjunctive position-by-velocity selectivity of grid cells. Our network model is able to perform robust path integration even when the recurrent connections are subject to random perturbations., How do animals self-localize when they explore the environments with variable velocities? One mechanism is dead reckoning or path-integration. Recent experiments on rodents show that such computation may be performed by grid cells in medial entorhinal cortex. Each grid cell fires strongly when the animal enters locations that define the vertices of a triangular grid. Some of the grid cells show grid firing patterns only when the animal runs along particular directions. Here, we propose that grid cells collectively represent arbitrary conjunctions of positions and movements of the animal. Due to asymmetric recurrent connections, the network has grid patterns as states that are able to move intrinsically with all possible directions and speeds. A velocity-tuned input will activate a subset of the population that prefers similar movements, and the pattern in the network moves with a velocity proportional to the movement of the animal in physical space, up to a fixed rotation. Thus the network ‘imagines’ the movement of the animal, and produces single cell grid firing responses in space with different degree of head-direction selectivity. We propose testable predictions for new experiments to verify our model.},

Establishing how grid cells are anatomically arranged, on a microscopic scale, in relation to their firing patterns in the environment would facilitate a greater microcircuit-level understanding of the brain’s representation of space. However, all previous grid cell recordings used electrode techniques that provide limited descriptions of fine-scale organization. We therefore developed a technique for cellular-resolution functional imaging of medial entorhinal cortex ({MEC}) neurons in mice navigating a virtual linear track, enabling a new experimental approach to study {MEC}. Using these methods, we show that grid cells are physically clustered in {MEC} compared to nongrid cells. Additionally, we demonstrate that grid cells are functionally micro-organized: the similarity between the environment firing locations of grid cell pairs varies as a function of the distance between them according to a “Mexican hat”-shaped profile. This suggests that, on average, nearby grid cells have more similar spatial firing phases than those further apart.},

The authors propose a model in which place fields of hippocampal pyramidal cells are formed by linear summation of appropriately weighted inputs from entorhinal grid cells. Single confined place fields could be formed by summing input from a modest number (10–50) of grid cells with relatively similar grid phases, diverse grid orientations, and a biologically plausible range of grid spacings. When the spatial phase variation in the grid-cell input was higher, multiple, and irregularly spaced firing fields were formed.

We report two major changes in entorhinal grid cells. First, hippocampal inactivation gradually and selectively extinguished the grid pattern. Second, the same grid cells that lost their grid fields acquired substantial tuning to the direction of the rat's head. This transition in firing properties was contingent on a drop in the average firing rate of the grid cells and could be replicated by the removal of an external excitatory drive in an attractor network model in which grid structure emerges by velocity-dependent translation of activity across a network with inhibitory connections. These results point to excitatory drive from the hippocampus, and possibly other regions, as one prerequisite for the formation and translocation of grid patterns in the {MEC}.

Conjunctive grid-by-head-direction cells lost grid cell spatial periodicity but retained head direction specificity. All cells showed reduced rhythmicity in autocorrelations and cross-correlations.

	abstract = {Grid cells of the medial entorhinal cortex exhibit a periodic and stable pattern of spatial tuning that may reflect the output of a path integration system. This grid pattern has been hypothesized to serve as a spatial coordinate system for navigation and memory function. The mechanisms underlying the generation of this characteristic tuning pattern remain poorly understood. Systemic administration of the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine flattens the typically positive correlation between running speed and entorhinal theta frequency in rats. The loss of this neural correlate of velocity, an important signal for the calculation of path integration, raises the question of what influence scopolamine has on the grid cell tuning as a read out of the path integration system. To test this, the spatial tuning properties of grid cells were compared before and after systemic administration of scopolamine as rats completed laps on a circle track for food rewards. The results show that the spatial tuning of the grid cells was reduced following scopolamine administration. The tuning of head direction cells, in contrast, was not reduced by scopolamine. This is the first report to demonstrate a link between cholinergic function and grid cell tuning. This work suggests that the loss of tuning in the grid cell network may underlie the navigational disorientation observed in Alzheimer's patients and elderly individuals with reduced cholinergic tone.},

However, this 'phase precession' effect is less well characterized during foraging in two-dimensional open field environments. Here, we mapped runs through the firing fields onto a unit circle to pool data from multiple runs. We asked which of seven behavioural and physiological variables show the best circular-linear correlation with the theta phase of spikes from place cells in hippocampal area {CA}1 and from grid cells from superficial layers of medial entorhinal cortex. The best correlate was the distance to the firing field peak projected onto the animal's current running direction. This was significantly stronger than other correlates, such as instantaneous firing rate and time-in-field, but similar in strength to correlates with other measures of distance travelled through the firing field. Phase precession was stronger in place cells than grid cells overall, and robust phase precession was seen in traversals through firing field peripheries (although somewhat less than in traversals through the centre), consistent with phase coding of displacement along the current direction. This type of phase coding, of place field distance ahead of or behind the animal, may be useful for allowing calculation of goal directions during navigation.},

The ventral limit of the spatial map is currently not known. To determine if the grid map extends into the intermediate and ventral parts of the medial entorhinal cortex, we recorded activity from entorhinal principal cells at multiple dorsoventral levels while rats shuttled back and forth on an 18 m long linear track. The recordings spanned a range of more than 3 mm, covering approximately three quarters of the dorsoventral extent of the medial entorhinal cortex. Distinct periodic firing fields were observed at all recording levels. The average interpeak distance between the fields increased from ∼50 cm in the most dorsal part to ∼3 m at the most ventral recording positions. The increase in grid scale was accompanied by a decrease in the frequency of theta modulation and the rate of phase precession. The increase in average spacing and field size was approximately linear but this relationship coincided with a substantial increase in the variability of each measure. Taken together, the observations suggest that the spatial scale of the grid representation increases progressively along most of the dorsoventral axis of the medial entorhinal cortex, mirroring the topographical scale expansion observed in place cells in the hippocampus. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Its key unit is the 'grid cell', which is activated whenever the animal's position coincides with any vertex of a regular grid of equilateral triangles spanning the surface of the environment. Grids of neighbouring cells share a common orientation and spacing, but their vertex locations (their phases) differ. The spacing and size of individual fields increase from dorsal to ventral {dMEC}.

The proportion of grid cells in pre- and parasubiculum was comparable to deep layers of {MEC}. The symmetry of the grid pattern and its relationship to the theta rhythm were weaker, especially in presubiculum. Pre- and parasubicular grid cells intermingled with head-direction cells and border cells, as in deep {MEC} layers. The characterization of a common pool of space-responsive cells in architecturally diverse subdivisions of parahippocampal cortex constrains the range of mechanisms that might give rise to their unique functional discharge phenotypes.

The last decade of neuroepigenetic research has primarily focused on learning-induced changes in {DNA} methylation and chromatin modifications. Numerous studies have independently demonstrated the importance of epigenetic modifications in memory formation and retention as well as Hebbian plasticity. However, how these mechanisms operate in the context of other forms of plasticity is largely unknown. In this review, we examine evidence for epigenetic regulation of Hebbian plasticity. We then discuss how non-Hebbian forms of plasticity, such as intrinsic plasticity and synaptic scaling, may also be involved in producing the cellular adaptations necessary for learning-related behavioral change. Furthermore, we consider the likely roles for transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms in the regulation of these plasticities. In doing so, we aim to expand upon the idea that epigenetic mechanisms are critical regulators of both Hebbian and non-Hebbian forms of plasticity that ultimately drive learning and memory.

The interactions between cortical and hippocampal circuits are critical for memory formation, yet their basic organization at the neuronal network level is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that a significant portion of neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex of freely behaving rats are phase locked to the hippocampal theta rhythm. In addition, we show that prefrontal neurons phase lock best to theta oscillations delayed by approximately 50 ms and confirm this hippocampo-prefrontal directionality and timing at the level of correlations between single cells. Finally, we find that phase locking of prefrontal cells is predicted by the presence of significant correlations with hippocampal cells at positive delays up to 150 ms. The theta-entrained activity across cortico-hippocampal circuits described here may be important for gating information flow and guiding the plastic changes that are believed to underlie the storage of information across these networks.},

	abstract = {Spatial learning and memory are important for navigation and formation of episodic memories. The hippocampus and medial entorhinal cortex ({MEC}) are key brain areas for spatial learning and memory. Place cells in hippocampus fire whenever an animal is located in a specific region in the environment. Grid cells in the superficial layers of {MEC} provide inputs to place cells and exhibit remarkable regular hexagonal spatial firing patterns. They also exhibit a gradient of spatial scales along the dorsoventral axis of the {MEC}, with neighboring cells at a given dorsoventral location having different spatial phases. A neural model shows how a hierarchy of self-organizing maps, each obeying the same laws, responds to realistic rat trajectories by learning grid cells with hexagonal grid firing fields of multiple spatial scales and place cells with unimodal firing fields that fit neurophysiological data about their development in juvenile rats. The hippocampal place fields represent much larger spaces than the grid cells to support navigational behaviors. Both the entorhinal and hippocampal self-organizing maps amplify and learn to categorize the most energetic and frequent co-occurrences of their inputs. Top–down attentional mechanisms from hippocampus to {MEC} help to dynamically stabilize these spatial memories in both the model and neurophysiological data. Spatial learning through {MEC} to hippocampus occurs in parallel with temporal learning through lateral entorhinal cortex to hippocampus. These homologous spatial and temporal representations illustrate a kind of “neural relativity” that may provide a substrate for episodic learning and memory.},

In glutamatergic neurons Aβ increases firing frequency and blocks the A- and the M-current ({IA} and {IM}, respectively). While the {IA} block is similar in other {MS} neuron classes, the block of {IM} is specific to glutamatergic neurons. {IM} block and a simulated Aβ block mimic the Aβ-induced increase in spontaneous firing in glutamatergic neurons. Calcium imaging shows that under control conditions glutamatergic neurons rarely fire while nonglutamatergic neurons fire coherently at theta frequencies. Aβ increases the firing rate of glutamatergic neurons while nonglutamatergic neurons lose theta firing coherence. Our results demonstrate that Aβ-induced dysfunction of glutamatergic neurons via {IM} decrease diminishes {MS} rhythmicity, which may negatively affect hippocampal rhythmogenesis and underlie the memory loss observed in Alzheimer's disease.},

	abstract = {During spatial navigation, the head orientation of an animal is encoded internally by neural persistent activity in the head-direction ({HD}) system. In computational models, such a bell-shaped “hill of activity” is commonly assumed to be generated by recurrent excitation in a continuous attractor network. Recent experimental evidence, however, indicates that {HD} signal in rodents originates in a reciprocal loop between the lateral mammillary nucleus ({LMN}) and the dorsal tegmental nucleus ({DTN}), which is characterized by a paucity of local excitatory axonal collaterals. Moreover, when the animal turns its head to a new direction, the heading information is updated by a time integration of angular head velocity ({AHV}) signals; the underlying mechanism remains unresolved. To investigate these issues, we built and investigated an {LMN}-{DTN} network model that consists of three populations of noisy and spiking neurons coupled by biophysically realistic synapses. We found that a combination of uniform external excitation and recurrent cross-inhibition can give rise to direction-selective persistent activity. The model reproduces the experimentally observed three types of {HD} tuning curves differentially modulated by {AHV} and anticipatory firing activity in {LMN} {HD} cells. Time integration is assessed by using constant or sinusoidal angular velocity stimuli, as well as naturalistic {AHV} inputs (from rodent recordings). Furthermore, the internal representation of head direction is shown to be calibrated or reset by strong external cues. We identify microcircuit properties that determine the ability of our model network to subserve time integration function.},

	abstract = {Although the presence and importance of oscillations in cortical structures is well-documented, little is known about this rhythmic activity in subcortical areas. In waking guinea pigs, during their inattentive rest, local field potentials ({LFPs}) were recorded simultaneously in eight brain structures. In the cortical areas (prefrontal and entorhinal fields, hippocampus, dentate gyrus) and subcortical ones (medial and lateral septal nuclei, central nucleus of amygdala, and supramammillary nucleus), different types of oscillations were observed: delta (0.5–4 Hz), theta (4–8), alpha (10–12), gamma (40–80), and high-frequency, presumable ripples (100–200 Hz). In all structures, low-frequency oscillations (delta and theta) were more powerful than high-frequency ones. Structural communications in different bands of rhythmic activity were expressed differently. On the whole they were the more intensive, the stronger were the oscillations, however, this was not the absolute rule. A long-term (about a month) daily injection of l-glutamate into the medial septal region induced significant changes in theta, gamma, and high-frequency oscillations in most regions examined. The correlations of some structures also changed; they significantly decreased between the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus in the theta band and between the medial septum and central amygdala in the gamma band. During permanent septal glutamate infusion, distinct signs of epileptogenesis were revealed (epileptiform activity, seizure behavior of animals, and formation of aberrant fibers in the hippocampus). Thus, we believe that the glutamatergic system of medial septum can participate in the development of epilepsy. The earliest sign of pathology in electrical activity was alterations in high-frequency oscillations in the dentate gyrus and medial septum, but the strongest changes were in theta and especially gamma rhythms in many structures. The data obtained help to advance our understanding of the basic mechanisms of brain functioning and its disturbances in seizure pathology.},

This activity, induced by the group I {mGluR} agonist ({RS})-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine ({DHPG}), was reduced by ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists and abolished by further addition of a {GABAA} receptor antagonist. However, addition of a {GABAA} receptor antagonist on its own converted the {DHPG}-induced oscillations to intermittent episodes of accentuated theta frequency activity following a burst. In a proportion of slices, {DHPG} induced large amplitude field population spiking activity (100–300 μV) which is correlated linearly with the field theta oscillations and is sensitive to glutamate receptor antagonists, suggesting a role of this type of spikes in theta generation induced by {DHPG}. These data demonstrate that {DHPG}-sensitive neuronal networks within medial septum generate theta rhythmic activity and are differentially modulated by excitatory and inhibitory ionotropic neurotransmissions.},

	abstract = {We expand upon our proposal that the oscillatory interference mechanism proposed for the phase precession effect in place cells underlies the grid-like firing pattern of dorsomedial entorhinal grid cells (O'Keefe and Burgess (2005) Hippocampus 15:853–866). The original one-dimensional interference model is generalized to an appropriate two-dimensional mechanism. Specifically, dendritic subunits of layer {II} medial entorhinal stellate cells provide multiple linear interference patterns along different directions, with their product determining the firing of the cell. Connection of appropriate speed- and direction- dependent inputs onto dendritic subunits could result from an unsupervised learning rule which maximizes postsynaptic firing (e.g. competitive learning). These inputs cause the intrinsic oscillation of subunit membrane potential to increase above theta frequency by an amount proportional to the animal's speed of running in the “preferred” direction. The phase difference between this oscillation and a somatic input at theta-frequency essentially integrates velocity so that the interference of the two oscillations reflects distance traveled in the preferred direction. The overall grid pattern is maintained in environmental location by phase reset of the grid cell by place cells receiving sensory input from the environment, and environmental boundaries in particular. We also outline possible variations on the basic model, including the generation of grid-like firing via the interaction of multiple cells rather than via multiple dendritic subunits. Predictions of the interference model are given for the frequency composition of {EEG} power spectra and temporal autocorrelograms of grid cell firing as functions of the speed and direction of running and the novelty of the environment. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {The oscillatory interference model (Burgess et al. (2007) Hippocampus 17:801–812) explains the generation of spatially stable, regular firing patterns by medial entorhinal cortical ({mEC}) grid cells in terms of the interference between velocity-controlled oscillators ({VCOs}) with different preferred directions. This model predicts specific relationships between the intrinsic firing frequency and spatial scale of grid cell firing, the {EEG} theta frequency, and running speed (Burgess,2008). Here, we use spectral analyses of {EEG} and of spike autocorrelograms to estimate the intrinsic firing frequency of grid cells, and the concurrent theta frequency, in {mEC} Layer {II} in freely moving rats. The intrinsic firing frequency of grid cells increased with running speed and decreased with grid scale, according to the quantitative prediction of the model. Similarly, theta frequency increased with running speed, which was also predicted by the model. An alternative Moiré interference model (Blair et al.,2007) predicts a direction-dependent variation in intrinsic firing frequency, which was not found. Our results suggest that interference between {VCOs} generates the spatial firing patterns of entorhinal grid cells according to the oscillatory interference model. They also provide specific constraints on this model of grid cell firing and have more general implications for viewing neuronal processing in terms of interfering oscillatory processes. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Oscillatory interference models of grid cells predict theta amplitude modulations of membrane potential during firing field traversals, whereas competing attractor network models predict slow depolarizing ramps. Here, using in vivo whole-cell recordings, we tested these models by directly measuring grid cell intracellular potentials in mice running along linear tracks in virtual reality. Grid cells had large and reproducible ramps of membrane potential depolarization that were the characteristic signature tightly correlated with firing fields. Grid cells also demonstrated intracellular theta oscillations that influenced their spike timing. However, the properties of theta amplitude modulations were not consistent with the view that they determine firing field locations. Our results support cellular and network mechanisms in which grid fields are produced by slow ramps, as in attractor models, whereas theta oscillations control spike timing.

	abstract = {The continuous wavelet transform ({CWT}) is specifically efficient in the analysis of transient and non-stationary signals. As such, it has become a powerful candidate for time–frequency analysis of cardiovascular variability. {CWT} has already been established as a valid tool for the analysis of single cardiovascular signals, providing additional insights into the autonomous nervous system ({ANS}) activity and its control mechanism. Intercorrelation between cardiovascular signals elucidates the function of {ANS} central control and the peripheral reflex mechanisms. Wavelet transform coherence ({WTC}) can provide insight into the transient linear order of the regulatory mechanisms, via the computation of time–frequency maps of the time-variant coherence. This paper presents a framework for applying {WTC} for quantitative analysis of coherence in cardiovascular variability research. Computer simulations were performed to estimate the accuracy of the {WTC} estimates and a method for determining the coherence threshold for specific frequency band was developed and evaluated. Finally, we demonstrated, in two representative situations, the dynamic behaviour of respiration sinus arrhythmia through the analysis of the {WTC} between heart rate and respiration signals. This emphasizes that {CWT} and its application to {WTC} is a useful tool for dynamic analysis of cardiovascular variability.},

First, some drawbacks and limitations of the commonly used Fast Fourier transforms ({FFTs}) are presented, and then alternative algorithms are outlined. An auto-regressive ({AR}) modeling based spectral estimation procedure is presented to overcome the problems of lower resolution and `leakage' effects inherent in the {FFT} algorithm. For signals which are transient in nature or rapidly time-varying, two alternative algorithms are presented. The first is an adaptive {AR} parameter estimation algorithm and the second is a wavelet based time-frequency representation algorithm. Finally, a Spectral Distance measure and the Itakura distance measure are presented to quantify the differences between the spectra of two signals in a succinct manner. The application and performance of all the algorithms is illustrated using electroencephalograms ({EEGs}) recorded in animals during hypoxic–asphyxic injury to brain.},

	abstract = {This article presents, for the first time, a practical method for the direct quantification of frequency-specific synchronization (i.e., transient phase-locking) between two neuroelectric signals. The motivation for its development is to be able to examine the role of neural synchronies as a putative mechanism for long-range neural integration during cognitive tasks. The method, called phase-locking statistics ({PLS}), measures the significance of the phase covariance between two signals with a reasonable time-resolution ({\textless}100 ms). Unlike the more traditional method of spectral coherence, {PLS} separates the phase and amplitude components and can be directly interpreted in the framework of neural integration. To validate synchrony values against background fluctuations, {PLS} uses surrogate data and thus makes no a priori assumptions on the nature of the experimental data. We also apply {PLS} to investigate intracortical recordings from an epileptic patient performing a visual discrimination task. We find large-scale synchronies in the gamma band (45 Hz), e.g., between hippocampus and frontal gyrus, and local synchronies, within a limbic region, a few cm apart. We argue that whereas long-scale effects do reflect cognitive processing, short-scale synchronies are likely to be due to volume conduction. We discuss ways to separate such conduction effects from true signal synchrony. Hum Brain Mapping 8:194–208, 1999. © 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

We examined phase–phase coupling of theta and gamma oscillators in the {CA}1 region of rat hippocampus during maze exploration and rapid eye movement sleep. Hippocampal theta waves were asymmetric, and estimation of the spatial position of the animal was improved by identifying the waveform-based phase of spiking, compared to traditional methods used for phase estimation. Using the waveform-based theta phase, three distinct gamma bands were identified: slow {gammaS} ({gammaS}; 30–50 Hz), midfrequency {gammaM} ({gammaM}; 50–90 Hz), and fast {gammaF} ({gammaF}; 90–150 Hz or epsilon band). The amplitude of each sub-band was modulated by the theta phase. In addition, we found reliable phase–phase coupling between theta and both {gammaS} and {gammaM} but not {gammaF} oscillators. We suggest that cross-frequency phase coupling can support multiple time-scale control of neuronal spikes within and across structures.},

	abstract = {Gamma rhythms are commonly observed in many brain regions during both waking and sleep states, yet their functions and mechanisms remain a matter of debate. Here we review the cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying gamma oscillations and outline empirical questions and controversial conceptual issues. Our main points are as follows: First, gamma-band rhythmogenesis is inextricably tied to perisomatic inhibition. Second, gamma oscillations are short-lived and typically emerge from the coordinated interaction of excitation and inhibition, which can be detected as local field potentials. Third, gamma rhythm typically concurs with irregular firing of single neurons, and the network frequency of gamma oscillations varies extensively depending on the underlying mechanism. To document gamma oscillations, efforts should be made to distinguish them from mere increases of gamma-band power and/or increased spiking activity. Fourth, the magnitude of gamma oscillation is modulated by slower rhythms. Such cross-frequency coupling may serve to couple active patches of cortical circuits. Because of their ubiquitous nature and strong correlation with the “operational modes” of local circuits, gamma oscillations continue to provide important clues about neuronal population dynamics in health and disease.},

Among other conditions, for synchronously firing presynaptic units to generate sizable postsynaptic {LFPs}, their axonal territories should overlap. We have taken advantage of anatomical regularity of the rat hippocampus and combined multiple linear recordings and spatial discrimination techniques to separate pathway-specific {LFPs} with enough spatial resolution to discriminate postsynaptic regions of varying activation, and to investigate their presynaptic origin, chemical nature, and spatial extension. We identified 6 main excitatory and inhibitory {LFP} generators with different synaptic territories in principal cells and hippocampal subfields matching anatomical pathways. Some recognized pathways did not contribute notably to {LFPs}. Each showed different septo-temporal spatial modules over which the field potential fluctuations were synchronous. These modules were explained by either the strong overlap of synaptic territories of coactivated afferent neurons (e.g., {CA}3 clusters for {CA}1 Schaffer {LFPs}), or widespread coalescence of postsynaptic territories (granule cell somatic inhibition). We also show evidence that distinct modes of afferent synchronization generate stereotyped spatial patterns of synchronous {LFPs} in one pathway. Thus, studying spatial coherence of pathway-specific {LFPs} provides remote access to the dynamics of afferent populations.},

Full characteristics including cognitive functions of the brain should ultimately be comprehended by building simulators capable of precisely mirroring spike responses of a variety of neurons. Neuronal modeling that had remained on a qualitative level has recently advanced to a quantitative level, but is still incapable of accurately predicting biological data and requires high computational cost. In this study, we devised a simple, fast computational model that can be tailored to any cortical neuron not only for reproducing but also for predicting a variety of spike responses to greatly fluctuating currents. The key features of this model are a multi-timescale adaptive threshold predictor and a nonresetting leaky integrator. This model is capable of reproducing a rich variety of neuronal spike responses, including regular spiking, intrinsic bursting, fast spiking, and chattering, by adjusting only three adaptive threshold parameters. This model can express a continuous variety of the firing characteristics in a three-dimensional parameter space rather than just those identified in the conventional discrete categorization. Both high flexibility and low computational cost would help to model the real brain function faithfully and examine how network properties may be influenced by the distributed characteristics of component neurons.},

Here, we show how the conundrum is resolved by a model network of cortical spiking neurons with spike-timing–dependent plasticity ({STDP}) modulated by dopamine ({DA}). Although {STDP} is triggered by nearly coincident firing patterns on a millisecond timescale, slow kinetics of subsequent synaptic plasticity is sensitive to changes in the extracellular {DA} concentration during the critical period of a few seconds. Random firings during the waiting period to the reward do not affect {STDP} and hence make the network insensitive to the ongoing activity—the key feature that distinguishes our approach from previous theoretical studies, which implicitly assume that the network be quiet during the waiting period or that the patterns be preserved until the reward arrives. This study emphasizes the importance of precise firing patterns in brain dynamics and suggests how a global diffusive reinforcement signal in the form of extracellular {DA} can selectively influence the right synapses at the right time.},

Changes in the strength of synaptic connections between neurons are believed to mediate processes of learning and memory in the brain. A computational theory of this synaptic plasticity was first provided by Donald Hebb within the context of a more general neural coding mechanism, whereby phase sequences of activity directed by ongoing external and internal dynamics propagate in mutually exciting ensembles of neurons. Empirical evidence for this cell assembly model has been obtained in the hippocampus, where neuronal ensembles encoding for spatial location repeatedly fire in sequence at different phases of the ongoing theta oscillation. To investigate the encoding and reactivation of these dual coded activity patterns, we examine a biologically inspired spiking neural network model of the hippocampus with a novel synaptic plasticity rule. We demonstrate that this allows the rapid development of both symmetric and asymmetric connections between neurons that fire at concurrent or consecutive theta phase respectively. Recall activity, corresponding to both pattern completion and sequence prediction, can subsequently be produced by partial external cues. This allows the reconciliation of two previously disparate classes of hippocampal model and provides a framework for further examination of cell assembly dynamics in spiking neural networks.},

It exhibits sleeplike oscillations, gamma (40 Hz) rhythms, conversion of firing rates to spike timings, and other interesting regimes. Due to the interplay between the delays and {STDP}, the spiking neurons spontaneously self-organize into groups and generate patterns of stereotypical polychronous activity. To our surprise, the number of coexisting polychronous groups far exceeds the number of neurons in the network, resulting in an unprecedented memory capacity of the system. We speculate on the significance of polychrony to the theory of neuronal group selection ({TNGS}, neural Darwinism), cognitive neural computations, binding and gamma rhythm, mechanisms of attention, and consciousness as "attention to memories."},

	abstract = {Restricted Boltzmann Machines ({RBMs}) and Deep Belief Networks have been demonstrated to perform efficiently in a variety of applications, such as dimensionality reduction, feature learning, and classification. Their implementation on neuromorphic hardware platforms emulating large-scale networks of spiking neurons can have significant advantages from the perspectives of scalability, power dissipation and real-time interfacing with the environment. However, the traditional {RBM} architecture and the commonly used training algorithm known as Contrastive Divergence ({CD}) are based on discrete updates and exact arithmetics which do not directly map onto a dynamical neural substrate. Here, we present an event-driven variation of {CD} to train a {RBM} constructed with Integrate \& Fire (I\&F) neurons, that is constrained by the limitations of existing and near future neuromorphic hardware platforms. Our strategy is based on neural sampling, which allows us to synthesize a spiking neural network that samples from a target Boltzmann distribution. The recurrent activity of the network replaces the discrete steps of the {CD} algorithm, while Spike Time Dependent Plasticity ({STDP}) carries out the weight updates in an online, asynchronous fashion. We demonstrate our approach by training an {RBM} composed of leaky I\&F neurons with {STDP} synapses to learn a generative model of the {MNIST} hand-written digit dataset, and by testing it in recognition, generation and cue integration tasks. Our results contribute to a machine learning-driven approach for synthesizing networks of spiking neurons capable of carrying out practical, high-level functionality.},

This study investigates, using current and voltage-clamp techniques in brain slices from young mice, the properties of I(h) currents in medial septum/diagonal band ({MS}/{DB}) neurons. Subsets of neurons in this complex, including {GABAergic} and cholinergic neurons, innervate the hippocampal formation, and play a role in modulating hippocampal theta rhythm. In support of a potential role for I(h) in regulating {MS}/{DB} firing properties and consequently hippocampal neuron rhythmicity, I(h) currents were present in around 60\% of midline {MS}/{DB} complex neurons. The I(h) currents were sensitive to the selective blocker {ZD}7288 (10 {microM}). The I(h) current had a time constant of activation of around 220 ms (at -130 {mV}), and tail current analysis revealed a half-activation voltage of -98 {mV}. Notably, the amplitude and kinetics of I(h) currents in {MS}/{DB} neurons were insensitive to the {cAMP} membrane permeable analogue 8-bromo-{cAMP} (1 {mM}), and application of muscarine (100 {microM}). Immunofluoresence using antibodies against {HCN}1, 2 and 4 channel subunits revealed that all three {HCN} subunits are expressed in neurons in the {MS}/{DB}, including neurons that express the calcium binding protein parvalbumin (marker of fast spiking {GABAergic} septo-hippocampal projection neurons). The results demonstrate, for the first time, that specific {HCN} channel subunits are likely to be coexpressed in subsets of {MS}/{DB} neurons, and that the resultant I(h) currents show both similarities, and differences, to previously described I(h) currents in other {CNS} neurons.},

	abstract = {Spatial information about the environment is encoded by the activity of place and grid cells in the hippocampal formation. As an animal traverses a cell's firing field, action potentials progressively shift to earlier phases of the theta oscillation (6–10 Hz). This “phase precession” is observed also in the prefrontal cortex and the ventral striatum, but mechanisms for its generation are unknown. However, once phase precession exists in one region, it might also propagate to downstream regions. Using a computational model, we analyze such inheritance of phase precession, for example, from the entorhinal cortex to {CA}1 and from {CA}3 to {CA}1. We find that distinctive subthreshold and suprathreshold features of the membrane potential of {CA}1 pyramidal cells (Harvey et al., 2009; Mizuseki et al., 2012; Royer et al., 2012) can be explained by inheritance and that excitatory input is essential. The model explains how inhibition modulates the slope and range of phase precession and provides two main testable predictions. First, theta-modulated inhibitory input to a {CA}1 pyramidal cell is not necessary for phase precession. Second, theta-modulated inhibitory input on its own generates membrane potential peaks that are in phase with peaks of the extracellular field. Furthermore, we suggest that the spatial distribution of field centers of a population of phase-precessing input cells determines, not only the place selectivity, but also the characteristics of phase precession of the targeted output cell. The inheritance model thus can explain why phase precession is observed throughout the hippocampal formation and other areas of the brain.},

In order to elucidate the possible mechanisms at the basis of this phenomenon, we have developed a model of sequence learning. The present model consists of two layers of place cell units. Long-range connections among units implement heteroassociation between the two layers, trained with a temporal Hebb rule. The network was trained assuming that a virtual rat moves within a virtual maze. This training leads to the formation of bidirectional synapses between the two layers, i.e. synapses connecting a neuron both with its previous and subsequent element in the path. Subsequently, two distinct conditions were simulated with the trained network. During an exploratory phase, characterized by a similar consideration to the external environment and to the internal representation, the model simulates the occurrence of theta precession in the forward path and the temporal compression. During an imagination phase, when there is no consideration to the external location, the model produces trains of gamma oscillations, without the presence of a theta rhythm, and simulates the occurrence of both direct and reverse replay, and the imagination of never experienced paths.

	abstract = {Two computational models are used to explore the possible implications of recent experimental data (Royer et al. 2012) on phasic inhibition during theta frequency (4–10 Hz) oscillations in the hippocampi of actively behaving rodents. A working hypothesis from previous experimental and modelling studies is that a theta cycle is divided into encoding (when synaptic plasticity is enhanced) and recall (when plasticity is suppressed) half cycles. Using a compartmental model of a {CA}1 pyramidal cell, including dendritic spines, we demonstrate that out-of-phase perisomatic and dendritic inhibition, respectively, can promote the necessary conditions for these half cycles. Perisomatic inhibition allows dendritic calcium spikes that promote synaptic {LTP}, while minimising cell output. Dendritic inhibition, on the other hand, both controls cell output and suppresses dendritic calcium spikes, preventing {LTP}. The exact phase relationship between these sub-cycles may not be fixed. Using a simple sum-of-sinusoids activity model, we suggest an interpretation of the data of Royer et al. (2012) in which a fixed-phase encoding sub-cycle is surrounded by a flexible-phase recall cycle that follows the peak of excitatory drive and consequent phase precession of activity as an animal passes through a pyramidal cell's place field.},

Although there is clear evidence that this precise spike timing is organized by theta and gamma oscillations that are present in hippocampus, the circuit mechanisms underlying these temporal codes remain poorly understood. We found that the loss of {CA}3 input abolished temporal coding at the ensemble level in {CA}1 despite the persistence of both rate and temporal coding in individual neurons. Moreover, low gamma oscillations were present in {CA}1 despite the absence of {CA}3 input, but spikes associated with these periods carried significantly reduced spatial information. Our findings dissociate temporal coding at the single-cell (phase precession) and population (theta sequences) levels and suggest that {CA}3 input is crucial for temporal coordination of the {CA}1 ensemble code for space.},

We demonstrate that hippocampal area {CA}1 generates atropine-resistant theta population oscillations in response to metabotropic glutamate receptor activation under conditions of reduced {AMPA} receptor activation. This activity occurred in the absence of inputs from area {CA}3 and extraammonic areas. Field theta oscillations were co-expressed with pyramidal distal apical dendritic burst spiking and were temporally related to trains of {IPSPs} with slow kinetics. Pyramidal somatic responses showed theta oscillations consisted of compound inhibitory synaptic potentials with initial {IPSPs} with slow kinetics followed by trains of smaller, faster {IPSPs}. Pharmacological modulation of {IPSPs} altered the theta oscillation suggesting an inhibitory network origin. Somatic {IPSPs}, dendritic burst firing and stratum pyramidale interneuron activity were all temporally correlated with spiking in stratum oriens interneurons demonstrating intrinsic theta-frequency oscillations. Disruption of spiking in these interneurons was accompanied by a loss of both field theta and theta frequency {IPSP} trains. We suggest that population theta oscillations can be generated as a consequence of intrinsic theta frequency spiking activity in a subset of stratum oriens interneurons controlling electrogenesis in pyramidal cell apical dendrites.},

	abstract = {The cerebral cortex encodes, stores and combines information about the internal and external environment in rhythmic activity of multiple frequency ranges. Neurones of the cortex can be defined, recognized and compared on the comprehensive application of the following measures: (i) brain area- and cell domain-specific distribution of input and output synapses, (ii) expression of molecules involved in cell signalling, (iii) membrane and synaptic properties reflecting the expression of membrane proteins, (iv) temporal structure of firing in vivo, resulting from (i)–(iii). Spatial and temporal measures of neurones in the network reflect an indivisible unity of evolutionary design, i.e. neurones do not have separate structure or function. The blueprint of this design is most easily accessible in the {CA}1 area of the hippocampus, where a relatively uniform population of pyramidal cells and their inputs follow an instantly recognizable laminated pattern and act within stereotyped network activity patterns. Reviewing the cell types and their spatio-temporal interactions, we suggest that {CA}1 pyramidal cells are supported by at least 16 distinct types of {GABAergic} neurone. During a given behaviour-contingent network oscillation, interneurones of a given type exhibit similar firing patterns. During different network oscillations representing two distinct brain states, interneurones of the same class show different firing patterns modulating their postsynaptic target-domain in a brain-state-dependent manner. These results suggest roles for specific interneurone types in structuring the activity of pyramidal cells via their respective target domains, and accurately timing and synchronizing pyramidal cell discharge, rather than providing generalized inhibition. Finally, interneurones belonging to different classes may fire preferentially at distinct time points during a given oscillation. As different interneurones innervate distinct domains of the pyramidal cells, the different compartments will receive {GABAergic} input differentiated in time. Such a dynamic, spatio-temporal, {GABAergic} control, which evolves distinct patterns during different brain states, is ideally suited to regulating the input integration of individual pyramidal cells contributing to the formation of cell assemblies and representations in the hippocampus and, probably, throughout the cerebral cortex.},

Interneurons also entrain pyramidal cells in vitro. The large diversity of interneurons poses the question of whether they have specific roles in shaping distinct network activities in vivo. Here we report that three distinct interneuron types—basket, axo-axonic and oriens–lacunosum-moleculare cells—visualized and defined by synaptic connectivity as well as by neurochemical markers, contribute differentially to theta and ripple oscillations in anaesthetized rats. The firing patterns of individual cells of the same class are remarkably stereotyped and provide unique signatures for each class. We conclude that the diversity of interneurons, innervating distinct domains of pyramidal cells, emerged to coordinate the activity of pyramidal cells in a temporally distinct and brain-state-dependent manner.},

	abstract = {Endogenous brain rhythms occurring at various frequencies and associated with distinct behavioral states provide multiscale temporal windows that enable cells to time their spiking activity with high precision, which is thought to be important for the coding of information in neuronal circuits. However, although the selective timing of {GABAergic} inputs to specific spatial domains of principal cells are known to play key roles in network oscillations, the in vivo firing patterns of distinct hippocampal interneurons in awake animals are not known. Here we used a combination of juxtacellular labeling techniques with recordings from anesthesia-free, head-fixed mice running or resting on a spherical treadmill to study the oscillation-dependent discharges by two major interneuronal subtypes, the perisomatically projecting parvalbumin-positive basket cells ({PVBCs}) and distal dendritically projecting oriens lacunosum moleculare ({OLM}) cells. Recordings of the spiking activity of post hoc-identified {CA}1 interneurons during theta (5–10 Hz), gamma (25–90Hz), epsilon (“high-gamma”; 90–130 Hz), and ripple (130–200 Hz) oscillations revealed both cell type- and behavioral state-dependent entrainments of {PVBC} and {OLM} cell discharges in awake mice. Our results in awake mice differed in several respects from previous data on interneuronal discharge patterns in anesthetized animals. In addition, our results demonstrate a form of frequency-invariant, cell type-specific temporal ordering of inhibitory inputs in which {PVBC}-derived perisomatic inhibition is followed by {OLM} cell-generated distal dendritic inhibition during each of the network oscillation bands studied, spanning more than an order of magnitude in frequencies.},

	abstract = {Theta oscillations are essential for learning and memory, and their generation requires {GABAergic} interneurons. To better understand how theta is generated, we explored how parvalbumin ({PV}) and somatostatin ({SOM}) interneurons in {CA}1 stratum oriens/alveus fire during hippocampal theta and investigated synaptic mechanisms underlying their behavior. Combining the use of transgenic mice to visually identify {PV} and {SOM} interneurons and the intact hippocampal preparation that can generate theta oscillations in vitro without cholinergic agonists, we performed simultaneous field and whole-cell recordings. We found that {PV} interneurons uniformly fire strongly phase-locked to theta, whereas {SOM} neurons are more heterogeneous with only a proportion of cells displaying tight phase-locking. Differences in phase-locking strength could be explained by disparity in excitatory inputs received; {PV} neurons received significantly larger {EPSCs} compared with {SOM} neurons, and the degree of phase-locking in {SOM} neurons was significantly correlated with the size of {EPSCs}. In contrast, {IPSC} amplitude did not differ between cell types. We determined that the local {CA}1 rhythm plays a more dominant role in driving {CA}1 interneuron firing than afferent inputs from the {CA}3. Last, we show that {PV} and strongly phase-locked {SOM} neurons fire near the peak of {CA}1 theta, under the tight control of excitatory inputs that arise at a specific phase of each theta cycle. These results reveal a fundamental mechanism of neuronal phase-locking and highlight an important role of excitation from the local network in governing firing behavior during rhythmic network states.
{SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT} Rhythmic activity in the theta range (3–12 Hz) is important for proper functioning of the hippocampus, a brain area essential for learning and memory. To understand how theta rhythm is generated, we investigated how two types of inhibitory neurons, those that express parvalbumin and somatostatin, fire action potentials during theta in an in vitro preparation of the mouse hippocampus. We found that the amount of excitatory input they receive from the local network determines how closely their spikes follow the network theta rhythm. Our findings reveal an important role of local excitatory input in driving inhibitory neuron firing during rhythmic states and may have implications for diseases, such as epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease, which affect the hippocampus and related areas.},

	abstract = {The medial septum and diagonal band of Broca ({MS}-{DBB}) has an essential role for theta rhythm generation in the hippocampus and is critical for learning and memory. The {MS}-{DBB} contains cholinergic, {GABAergic}, and recently described glutamatergic neurons, but their specific contribution to theta generation is poorly understood. Here, we examined the role of {MS}-{DBB} glutamatergic neurons in theta rhythm using optogenetic activation and electrophysiological recordings performed in in vitro preparations and in freely behaving mice. The experiments in slices suggest that {MS}-{DBB} glutamatergic neurons provide prominent excitatory inputs to a majority of local {GABAergic} and a minority of septal cholinergic neurons. In contrast, activation of {MS}-{DBB} glutamatergic fiber terminals in hippocampal slices elicited weak postsynaptic responses in hippocampal neurons. In the in vitro septo-hippocampal preparation, activation of {MS}-{DBB} glutamatergic neurons did increase the rhythmicity of hippocampal theta oscillations, whereas stimulation of septo-hippocampal glutamatergic fibers in the fornix did not have an effect. In freely behaving mice, activation of these neurons in the {MS}-{DBB} strongly synchronized hippocampal theta rhythms over a wide range of frequencies, whereas activation of their projections to the hippocampus through fornix stimulations had no effect on theta rhythms, suggesting that {MS}-{DBB} glutamatergic neurons played a role in theta generation through local modulation of septal neurons. Together, these results provide the first evidence that {MS}-{DBB} glutamatergic neurons modulate local septal circuits, which in turn contribute to theta rhythms in the hippocampus.
{SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT} The current paper explores the functional role of septal glutamatergic neurons, a recently identified population, in theta rhythm generation in the hippocampus. Using optogenetics and electrophysiology, we have explored the functional connectivity of these neurons in vitro, as well as their influence on theta rhythms both in vitro and in vivo, and show that this neuronal population can powerfully drive theta rhythms through intraseptal connections. These results strongly suggest a role of glutamatergic neurons in theta rhythm generation and may therefore be important for learning and memory.},

In the hippocampus, this is observed during population bursts often associated with sharp-wave ripples, in the form of an ordered reactivation of neurons. However, the organization and lifetime of these assemblies remain unknown. We used calcium imaging to map patterns of synchronous neuronal activation in the {CA}1 region of awake mice during runs on a treadmill. The patterns were composed of the recurring activation of anatomically intermingled, but functionally orthogonal, assemblies. These assemblies reactivated discrete temporal segments of neuronal sequences observed during runs and could be stable across consecutive days. A binding of these assemblies into longer chains revealed temporally ordered replay. These modules may represent the default building blocks for encoding or retrieving experience.},

The underlying cellular and network mechanisms that generate the theta rhythm, however, are poorly understood. Oriens-lacunosum moleculare (O-{LM}) interneurons have been implicated as crucial contributors to generating theta in local hippocampal circuits because of their unique axonal projections, slow synaptic kinetics and the fact that spikes are phase-locked to theta field potentials in vivo. We performed experiments in brain slice preparations from Long–Evans rats to investigate the ability of O-{LM} cells to generate phase-locked spike output in response to artificial synaptic inputs. We find that O-{LM} cells do not respond with any preference in spike output at theta frequencies when injected with broadband artificial synaptic inputs. However, when presented with frequency-modulated inputs, O-{LM} spike output shows the ability to phase-lock well to theta-modulated inputs, despite their strong low-pass profiles of subthreshold membrane impedance. This result was dependent on spike refractory dynamics and could be controlled by real-time manipulation of the postspike afterhyperpolarization. Finally, we show that the ability of O-{LM} cells to phase-lock well to theta-rich inputs is independent of the h-current, a membrane mechanism often implicated in the generation of theta frequency activity.},

The aim of the document is to provide a framework for classifying and evaluating different models of plasticity. We focus on phenomenological synaptic models that are compatible with integrate-and-fire type neuron models where each neuron is described by a small number of variables. This implies that synaptic update rules for short-term or long-term plasticity can only depend on spike timing and, potentially, on membrane potential, as well as on the value of the synaptic weight, or on low-pass filtered (temporally averaged) versions of the above variables. We examine the ability of the models to account for experimental data and to fulfill expectations derived from theoretical considerations. We further discuss their relations to teacher-based rules (supervised learning) and reward-based rules (reinforcement learning).

Traditionally, the two electrophysiological parameters used for this indirect investigation are the amplitude and latency of the response. The amplitude measures amount of transmitter released; the latency (synaptic delay) reflects the kinetics of a sequence of events that culminates in release. The latency distribution of quantal events, or the time course of composite evoked responses, can be used to infer the time course of the elevated release probability following a stimulus. Recent studies have demonstrated that synaptic delay is not invariant, but is modifiable during several forms of short-term synaptic plasticity. This suggests that the step of transmitter secretion can be modulated directly. Several models for short-term synaptic plasticity are evaluated in the context of the observed changes in synaptic delay.},

Hippocamposeptal neurons provide direct inhibitory feedback from the hippocampus onto septal cells, and are therefore likely to also play an important role in the circuit; these neurons fire at either low or high frequency, reflecting hippocampal network activity during theta oscillations or ripple events, respectively. Here, we optogenetically target the long-range {GABAergic} projection from the hippocampus to the medial septum in rats, and thereby simulate hippocampal input onto downstream septal cells in an acute slice preparation. In response to optogenetic activation of hippocamposeptal fibers at theta and ripple frequencies, we elicit postsynaptic {GABAergic} responses in a subset (24\%) of septal cells, most predominantly in fast-spiking cells. In addition, in another subset of septal cells (19\%) corresponding primarily to cholinergic cells, we observe a slow hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential and a decrease in input resistance, particularly in response to prolonged high-frequency (ripple range) stimulation. This slow response is partially sensitive to {GIRK} channel and D2 dopamine receptor block. Our results suggest that two independent populations of septal cells distinctly encode hippocampal feedback, enabling the septum to monitor ongoing patterns of activity in the hippocampus.},

A model of the dentate gyrus ({DG}), {CA}3 and {CA}1 microcircuits is presented that uses biophysical representations of the major cell types including granule cells, {CA}3 and {CA}1 pyramidal cells ({PCs}) and six types of interneurons: basket cells ({BCs}), axo-axonic cells ({AACs}), bistratified cells ({BSCs}), oriens lacunosum-moleculare cells ({OLMs}), mossy cells ({MCs}) and hilar perforant path associated cells ({HC}). Inputs to the network came from the entorhinal cortex ({EC}) (layers 2 and 3) and the medial septum ({MS}). The model simulates accurately the timing of firing of different hippocampal cells with respect to the theta rhythm. The model shows that the experimentally reported long temporal delays in the {DG}, {CA}3 and {CA}1 hippocampal regions are due to theta modulated somatic and axonic inhibition. The model further predicts that the phase at which the {CA}1 {PCs} fire with respect to the theta rhythm is determined primarily by their increased dendritic excitability caused by the decrease of the axial resistance and the A-type K+ conductance along their dendritic trunk. The model predicted latencies by which the {DG}, {CA}3 and {CA}1 principal cells fire are inline with the experimental evidence. Finally, the model proposes functional roles for the different inhibitory interneurons in the retrieval of the memory pattern by the {DG}, {CA}3 and {CA}1 networks. The model makes a number of predictions, which can be tested experimentally, thus leading to a better understanding of the biophysical computations in the hippocampus.},

	abstract = {The neuron population of the hippocampal formation exhibits oscillatory activity within the theta (θ) frequency band (4–10 Hz), and the intrinsic resonance properties of individual hippocampal neurons contribute to this network oscillation. The subiculum is the pivotal output region of the hippocampal formation and it is involved in many of the physiological and pathological functions of the limbic system. To study the characteristics and underlying mechanisms of resonance activity in subicular pyramidal neurons, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from these neurons in rat horizontal brain slices. We applied sinusoidal currents with constant amplitudes and linearly increasing frequencies to measure the resonance frequency of subicular pyramidal neurons. We found that the resonance frequency of subicular pyramidal neurons was about 2 Hz at room temperature and 4–6 Hz at 32–35 °C. The resonance frequency increased at hyperpolarized membrane potentials and decreased at depolarized membrane potentials. We also investigated three sub-threshold currents involved in the resonance: a slow hyperpolarization-activated cation current; an instantaneously activating, inwardly rectifying potassium current; and an inwardly persistent sodium current. The application of {ZD}7288 abolished the resonance hump, indicating that hyperpolarization-activated cation current generated resonance. The application of Ba2+ enlarged the resonance hump at hyperpolarized potentials below −80 {mV}, indicating that inwardly rectifying potassium current attenuated resonance. The application of {TTX} suppressed the resonance at depolarized potentials, indicating that persistent sodium current amplified resonance when neurons were depolarized. Thus, there is a θ-frequency resonance mediated by hyperpolarization-activated cation current in subicular pyramidal neurons. This θ-frequency resonance of individual subicular pyramidal neurons may participate in the population’s θ oscillation and contribute to the functions of the subiculum.},

	abstract = {The oriens-lacunosum moleculare (O-{LM}) subtype of interneuron is a key component in the formation of the theta rhythm (8–12 Hz) in the hippocampus. It is known that the {CA}1 region of the hippocampus can produce theta rhythms in vitro with all ionotropic excitation blocked, but the mechanisms by which this rhythmicity happens were previously unknown. Here we present a model suggesting that individual O-{LM} cells, by themselves, are capable of producing a single-cell theta-frequency firing, but coupled O-{LM} cells are not capable of producing a coherent population theta. By including in the model fast-spiking ({FS}) interneurons, which give rise to {IPSPs} that decay faster than those of the O-{LM} cells, coherent theta rhythms are produced. The inhibition to O-{LM} cells from the {FS} cells synchronizes the O-{LM} cells, but only when the {FS} cells themselves fire at a theta frequency. Reciprocal connections from the O-{LM} cells to the {FS} cells serve to parse the {FS} cell firing into theta bursts, which can then synchronize the O-{LM} cells. A component of the model O-{LM} cell critical to the synchronization mechanism is the hyperpolarization-activated h-current. The model can robustly reproduce relative phases of theta frequency activity in O-{LM} and {FS} cells.},

	abstract = {Summary
Whether the activation of spiking cell ensembles can be encoded in the local field potential ({LFP}) remains unclear. We address this question by combining in vivo electrophysiological recordings in the rat hippocampus with realistic biophysical modeling, and explore the {LFP} of place cell sequence spiking (“replays”) during sharp wave ripples. We show that multi-site perisomatic {LFP} amplitudes, in the ∼150–200 Hz frequency band, reliably reflect spatial constellations of spiking cells, embedded within non-spiking populations, and encode activation of local place cell ensembles during in vivo replays. We find spatiotemporal patterns in the {LFP}, which remain consistent between sequence replays, in conjunction with the ordered activation of place cell ensembles. Clustering such patterns provides an efficient segregation of replay events from non-replay-associated ripples. This work demonstrates how spatiotemporal ensemble spiking is encoded extracellularly, providing a window for efficient, {LFP}-based detection and monitoring of structured population activity in vivo.},

A model of the {CA}3 subfield of the hippocampus is presented, using biophysical representations of the major cell types including pyramidal cells and two types of interneurons. Inputs to the network come from the septum and the entorhinal cortex (directly and by the dentate gyrus). A mechanism for parsing the theta rhythm into two epochs is proposed and simulated: in the first half, the strong, proximal input from the dentate to a subset of {CA}3 pyramidal cells and coincident, direct input from the entorhinal cortex to other pyramidal cells creates an environment for strengthening synapses between cells, thus encoding information. During the second half of theta, cueing signals from the entorhinal cortex, by the dentate, activate previously strengthened synapses, retrieving memories. Slow inhibitory neurons (O-{LM} cells) play a role in the disambiguation during retrieval. We compare and contrast our computational results with existing experimental data and other contemporary models.},

	abstract = {1. We have developed a 19-compartment cable model of a guinea pig {CA}3 pyramidal neuron. Each compartment is allowed to contain six active ionic conductances: {gNa}, {gCa}, {gK}({DR}) (where {DR} stands for delayed rectifier), {gK}(A), {gK}({AHP}), and {gK}(C). {THe} conductance {gCa} is of the high-voltage activated type. The model kinetics for the first five of these conductances incorporate voltage-clamp data obtained from isolated hippocampal pyramidal neurons. The kinetics of {gK}(C) are based on data from bullfrog sympathetic neurons. The time constant for decay of submembrane calcium derives from optical imaging of Ca signals in Purkinje cell dendrites. 2. To construct the model from available voltage-clamp data, we first reproduced current-clamp records from a model isolated neuron (soma plus proximal dendrites). We next assumed that ionic channel kinetics in the dendrites were the same as in the soma. In accord with dendritic recordings and calcium-imaging data, we also assumed that significant {gCa} occurs in dendrites. We then attached sections of basilar and apical dendritic cable. By trial and error, we found a distribution (not necessarily unique) of ionic conductance densities that was consistent with current-clamp records from the soma and dendrites of whole neurons and from isolated apical dendrites. 3. The resulting model reproduces the Ca(2+)-dependent spike depolarizing afterpotential ({DAP}) recorded after a stimulus subthreshold for burst elicitation. 4. The model also reproduces the behavior of {CA}3 pyramidal neurons injected with increasing somatic depolarizing currents: low-frequency (0.3-1.0 Hz) rhythmic bursting for small currents, with burst frequency increasing with current magnitude; then more irregular bursts followed by afterhyperpolarizations ({AHPs}) interspersed with brief bursts without {AHPs}; and finally, rhythmic action potentials without bursts. 5. The model predicts the existence of still another firing pattern during tonic depolarizing dendritic stimulation: brief bursts at less than 1 to approximately 12 Hz, a pattern not observed during somatic stimulation. These bursts correspond to rhythmic dendritic calcium spikes. 6. The model {CA}3 pyramidal neuron can be made to resemble functionally a {CA}1 pyramidal neuron by increasing {gK}({DR}) and decreasing dendritic {gCa} and {gK}(C). Specifically, after these alterations, tonic depolarization of the soma leads to adapting repetitive firing, whereas stimulation of the distal dendrites leads to bursting. 7. A critical set of parameters concerns the regulation of the pool of intracellular [Ca2+] that interacts with membrane channels ({gK}(C) and {gK}({AHP})), particularly in the dendrites.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

	abstract = {Despite remarkable efforts, metastatic melanoma ({MM}) still presents with significant mortality. Recently, mono-chemotherapies are increasingly replenished by more cancer-specific combination therapies involving death ligands and drugs interfering with cell signaling. Still, {MM} remains a fatal disease because tumors rapidly develop resistance to novel therapies thereby regaining tumorigenic capacity. Although genetically engineered mouse models for {MM} have been developed, at present no model is available that reliably mimics the human disease and is suitable for studying mechanisms of therapeutic obstacles including cell death resistance. To improve the increasing requests on new therapeutic alternatives, reliable human screening models are demanded that translate the findings from basic cellular research into clinical applications. By developing an organotypic full skin equivalent, harboring melanoma tumor spheroids of defined sizes we have invented a cell-based model that recapitulates both the 3D organization and multicellular complexity of an organ/tumor in vivo but at the same time accommodates systematic experimental intervention. By extending our previous findings on melanoma cell sensitization toward {TRAIL} (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) by co-application of sublethal doses of ultraviolet-B radiation ({UVB}) or cisplatin, we show significant differences in the therapeutical outcome to exist between regular two-dimensional (2D) and complex in vivo-like 3D models. Of note, while both treatment combinations killed the same cancer cell lines in 2D culture, skin equivalent-embedded melanoma spheroids are potently killed by {TRAIL}+cisplatin treatment but remain almost unaffected by the {TRAIL}+{UVB} combination. Consequently, we have established an organotypic human skin-melanoma model that will facilitate efforts to improve therapeutic outcomes for malignant melanoma by providing a platform for the investigation of cytotoxic treatments and tailored therapies in a more physiological setting.},

However, these sequences have only been studied in the context of spatial tasks and never in humans. Here, we recorded magnetoencephalography ({MEG}) while human subjects performed a novel non-spatial reasoning task. The task required selecting paths through a set of six visual objects. We trained pattern classifiers on the {MEG} activity elicited by direct presentation of the visual objects alone and tested these classifiers on activity recorded during periods when no object was presented. During these object-free periods, the brain spontaneously visited representations of approximately four objects in fast sequences lasting on the order of 120 ms. These sequences followed backward trajectories along the permissible paths in the task. Thus, spontaneous fast sequential representation of states can be measured non-invasively in humans, and these sequences may be a fundamental feature of neural computation across tasks.},

	abstract = {Large datasets are becoming more and more common in science, particularly in neuroscience where experimental techniques are rapidly evolving. Obtaining interpretable results from raw data can sometimes be done automatically; however, there are numerous situations where there is a need, at all processing stages, to visualize the data in an interactive way. This enables the scientist to gain intuition, discover unexpected patterns, and find guidance about subsequent analysis steps. Existing visualization tools mostly focus on static publication-quality figures and do not support interactive visualization of large datasets. While working on Python software for visualization of neurophysiological data, we developed techniques to leverage the computational power of modern graphics cards for high-performance interactive data visualization. We were able to achieve very high performance despite the interpreted and dynamic nature of Python, by using state-of-the-art, fast libraries such as {NumPy}, {PyOpenGL}, and {PyTables}. We present applications of these methods to visualization of neurophysiological data. We believe our tools will be useful in a broad range of domains, in neuroscience and beyond, where there is an increasing need for scalable and fast interactive visualization.},

The variability in firing of neurons occurring naturally in different preparations was explored. In a presumptive single central spinal neuron, the firing pattern provided a single cluster. During bursting in a presumptive single primary afferent, the Poincaré maps provided information on interburst intervals. Moreover, lengthening and or shortening of interspike intervals within bursts can be detected in the maps.

	abstract = {Background
New, silicon-based multielectrodes comprising hundreds or more electrode contacts offer the possibility to record spike trains from thousands of neurons simultaneously. This potential cannot be realized unless accurate, reliable automated methods for spike sorting are developed, in turn requiring benchmarking data sets with known ground-truth spike times.
New method
We here present a general simulation tool for computing benchmarking data for evaluation of spike-sorting algorithms entitled {ViSAPy} (Virtual Spiking Activity in Python). The tool is based on a well-established biophysical forward-modeling scheme and is implemented as a Python package built on top of the neuronal simulator {NEURON} and the Python tool {LFPy}.
Results
{ViSAPy} allows for arbitrary combinations of multicompartmental neuron models and geometries of recording multielectrodes. Three example benchmarking data sets are generated, i.e., tetrode and polytrode data mimicking in vivo cortical recordings and microelectrode array ({MEA}) recordings of in vitro activity in salamander retinas. The synthesized example benchmarking data mimics salient features of typical experimental recordings, for example, spike waveforms depending on interspike interval.
Comparison with existing methods
{ViSAPy} goes beyond existing methods as it includes biologically realistic model noise, synaptic activation by recurrent spiking networks, finite-sized electrode contacts, and allows for inhomogeneous electrical conductivities. {ViSAPy} is optimized to allow for generation of long time series of benchmarking data, spanning minutes of biological time, by parallel execution on multi-core computers.
Conclusion
{ViSAPy} is an open-ended tool as it can be generalized to produce benchmarking data or arbitrary recording-electrode geometries and with various levels of complexity.},

However, bursts are difficult to identify because bursting activities or patterns vary with physiological conditions or external stimuli. In this paper, a simple method automatically to detect bursts in spike trains is described. This method auto-adaptively sets a parameter (mean inter-spike interval) according to intrinsic properties of the detected burst spike trains, without any arbitrary choices or any operator judgment. When the mean value of several successive inter-spike intervals is not larger than the parameter, a burst is identified. By this method, bursts can be automatically extracted from different bursting patterns of cultured neurons on multi-electrode arrays, as accurately as by visual inspection. Furthermore, significant changes of burst variables caused by electrical stimulus have been found in spontaneous activity of neuronal network. These suggest that the mean inter-spike interval method is robust for detecting changes in burst patterns and characteristics induced by environmental alterations.},

For assessing the potential use of the proposed method in practice we compared the results obtained to the results that would be obtained by adopting a buy-and-hold strategy. The key performance measure in this comparison was profitability. The proposed method was shown to generate considerable higher profits than buy-and-hold for most of the companies, with few buy operations generated and, consequently, minimizing the risk of market exposure.},

	abstract = {The hippocampus participates in multiple functions, including spatial navigation, adaptive timing and declarative (notably, episodic) memory. How does it carry out these particular functions? The present article proposes that hippocampal spatial and temporal processing are carried out by parallel circuits within entorhinal cortex, dentate gyrus and {CA}3 that are variations of the same circuit design. In particular, interactions between these brain regions transform fine spatial and temporal scales into population codes that are capable of representing the much larger spatial and temporal scales that are needed to control adaptive behaviors. Previous models of adaptively timed learning propose how a spectrum of cells tuned to brief but different delays are combined and modulated by learning to create a population code for controlling goal-oriented behaviors that span hundreds of milliseconds or even seconds. Here it is proposed how projections from entorhinal grid cells can undergo a similar learning process to create hippocampal place cells that can cover a space of many meters that are needed to control navigational behaviors. The suggested homology between spatial and temporal processing may clarify how spatial and temporal information may be integrated into an episodic memory. The model proposes how a path integration process activates a spatial map of grid cells. Path integration has a limited spatial capacity, and must be reset periodically, leading to the observed grid cell periodicity. Integration-to-map transformations have been proposed to exist in other brain systems. These include cortical mechanisms for numerical representation in the parietal cortex. As in the grid-to-place cell spatial expansion, the analog representation of number is extended by additional mechanisms to represent much larger numbers. The model also suggests how visual landmarks may influence grid cell activities via feedback projections from hippocampal place cells to the entorhinal cortex.},

	abstract = {Although most observers agree that the hippocampus has a critical role in learning and memory, there remains considerable debate about the precise functional contribution of the hippocampus to these processes. Two of the most influential accounts hold that the primary function of the hippocampus is to generate cognitive maps and to mediate episodic memory processes. The well-documented spatial firing patterns (place fields) of hippocampal neurons in rodents, along with the spatial learning impairments observed with hippocampal damage support the cognitive mapping hypothesis. The amnesia for personally experienced events seen in humans with hippocampal damage and the data of animal models, which show severe memory deficits associated with hippocampal lesions, support the episodic memory account. Although an extensive literature supports each of these hypotheses, a specific contribution of place cells to episodic memory has not been clearly demonstrated. Recent data from our laboratory, together with previous findings, indicate that hippocampal place fields and neuronal responses to task-relevant stimuli are highly sensitive to the context, even when the contexts are defined by abstract task demands rather than the spatial geometry of the environment. On the basis of these findings, it is proposed that place fields reflect a more general context processing function of the hippocampus. Hippocampal context representations could serve to differentiate contexts and prime the relevant memories and behaviors. Since episodic memories, by definition, include information about the time and place where the episode occurred, contextual information is a necessary prerequisite for any episodic memory. Thus, place fields contribute importantly to episodic memory as part of the needed context representations. Additionally, recent findings indicate that hippocampal neurons differentiate contexts at progressively finer levels of detail, suggesting a hierarchical coding scheme which, if combined with temporal information, could provide a means of differentiating memory episodes. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

These functions are dissimilar in terms of their behavioral consequences and modality of representation. Consequently, theoretical standpoints have focused on explaining the role of the hippocampal formation in terms of either its spatial or nonspatial functions. Contrary to this dichotomy, we propose that it is essential to look beyond these traditional boundaries between mnemonic and spatial functions and focus instead on the processes that these functions have in common. In this framework, we use electrophysiology data from the spatial domain to predict effects on the systems level, both in spatial and nonspatial domains. We initially outline the results of studies that have used findings from spatial navigation in rodents to predict the patterns of brain activity observable in people who are exploring virtual environments. We discuss how certain properties of space-defining neurons enable space to be represented as a mental map of interconnected locations, which are expressed at multiple spatial scales in separate modules in the hippocampal formation. We then suggest that memories are also organized in networks, characterized by mnemonic and temporal hierarchies. We finish by discussing how virtual-reality techniques can be used to create novel lifelike episodes allowing us to look at episodic memory processes while multivariate analysis tools can be used to explore the organizational structure of mnemonic networks.},

Particular focus has been given to characterising theta (4–12 Hz), gamma (40–100 Hz) and ripple (150–250 Hz) oscillations. Beyond these well-described network states, few studies have investigated hippocampal beta2 (23–30 Hz) activity in vivo and its link to behaviour. A previous sudy showed that the exploration of novel environments may lead to the appearance of beta2 oscillations in the mouse hippocampus. In the present study we characterised hippocampal beta2 oscillations in mice during an object recognition task. We found prominent bursts of beta2 oscillations in the beginning of novel exploration sessions (four new objects), which could be readily observed by spectral analysis and visual inspection of local field potentials. Beta2 modulated hippocampal but not neocortical neurons and its power decreased along the session. We also found increased beta2 power in the beginning of a second exploration session performed 24 h later in a slightly modified environment (two new, two familiar objects), but to a lesser extent than in the first session. However, the increase in beta2 power in the second exploration session became similar to the first session when we pharmacologically impaired object recognition in a new set of experiments performed 1 week later. Our results suggest that hippocampal beta2 activity is associated with a dynamic network state tuned for novelty detection and which may allow new learning to occur.},

	abstract = {The detection and processing of novel information encountered as we explore our environment is crucial for learning and adaptive behavior. The human hippocampus has been strongly implicated in laboratory tests of novelty detection and episodic memory, but has been less well studied during more ethological tasks such as spatial navigation, typically used in animals. We examined {fMRI} {BOLD} activity as a function of environmental and object novelty as humans performed an object-location virtual navigation task. We found greater {BOLD} response to novel relative to familiar environments in the hippocampus and adjacent parahippocampal gyrus. Object novelty was associated with increased activity in the posterior parahippocampal/fusiform gyrus and anterior hippocampus extending into the amygdala and superior temporal sulcus. Importantly, whilst mid-posterior hippocampus was more sensitive to environmental novelty than object novelty, the anterior hippocampus responded similarly to both forms of novelty. Amygdala activity showed an increase for novel objects that decreased linearly over the learning phase. By investigating how participants learn and use different forms of information during spatial navigation, we found that medial temporal lobe ({MTL}) activity reflects both the novelty of the environment and of the objects located within it. This novelty processing is likely supported by distinct, but partially overlapping, sets of regions within the {MTL}.},

Lipophilic {CM}-H was oxidized by {PETC} components, reducing the oxidized donor of Photosystem I, P700+, while at the same concentration another lipophilic {CHA}, {TMT}-H, did not reduce P700+. The nitroxide radical was able to accept electrons from components of the photosynthetic chain. Electrostatic interaction of stable cation {CAT}1-H with the membrane surface was suggested. Water-soluble superoxide dismutase ({SOD}) was added in order to suppress the reaction of {CHA} with O2∙− outside the membrane. {SOD} almost completely inhibited light-induced accumulation of {DCP}∙, nitroxide radical derivative of hydrophilic {DCP}-H, in contrast to {TMT}∙ accumulation. Based on the results showing that change in the thylakoid lumen {pH} and volume had minor effect on {TMT}∙ accumulation, the reaction of {TMT}-H with O2∙− in the lumen was excluded. Addition of {TMT}-H to thylakoid suspension in the presence of {SOD} resulted in the increase in light-induced O2 uptake rate, that argued in favor of {TMT}-H ability to detect O2∙− produced within the membrane core. Thus, hydrophilic {DCP}-H and lipophilic {TMT}-H were shown to be usable for detection of O2∙− produced outside and within thylakoid membranes.},

This Perspective assesses progress in elucidating five basic brain processes: visual recognition, long-term memory, short-term memory, action selection, and motor control. Each of these processes entails several levels of analysis: the behavioral properties, the underlying computational algorithm, and the cellular/network mechanisms that implement that algorithm. At this juncture, while many questions remain unanswered, achievements in several areas of research have made it possible to relate specific properties of brain networks to cognitive functions. What has been learned reveals, at least in rough outline, how cognitive processes can be an emergent property of neurons and their connections.},

Empirical evidence and computational work have provided biologically plausible models of the neural substrate and mechanisms underlying the coding of stimulus novelty in the perirhinal cortex. In this article, we highlight the importance of a different category of novelty, namely associative novelty, which has received relatively little attention, despite its clear ecological importance. While previous studies in both animals and humans have documented hippocampal responses in relation to associative novelty, a key issue concerning the computations underlying these novelty signals has not been previously addressed. We argue that this question has importance not only for our understanding of novelty processing, but also for advancing our knowledge of the fundamental computational operations performed by the hippocampus. We suggest a different approach to this problem, and discuss recent evidence supporting the hypothesis that the hippocampus operates as a comparator during the processing of associative novelty, generating mismatch/novelty signals when prior predictions are violated by sensory reality. We also draw on conceptual similarities between associative novelty and contextual novelty to suggest that empirical findings from these two seemingly distant research fields accord with the operation of a comparator mechanism during novelty detection more generally. We therefore conclude that a comparator mechanism may underlie the role of the hippocampus not only in detecting occurrences that are unexpected given specific associatively retrieved predictions, but also events that violate more abstract properties of the experimental context. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Results: One intention-to-treat Class I randomized controlled trial of surgery for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy found that 58\% of patients randomized to be evaluated for surgical therapy (64\% of those who received surgery) were free of disabling seizures and 10 to 15\% were unimproved at the end of 1 year, compared with 8\% free of disabling seizures in the group randomized to continued medical therapy. There was a significant improvement in quantitative quality-of-life scores and a trend toward better social function at the end of 1 year for patients in the surgical group, no surgical mortality, and infrequent morbidity. Twenty-four Class {IV} series of temporal lobe resections yielded essentially identical results. There are similar Class {IV} results for localized neocortical resections; no Class I or {II} studies are available. Conclusions: A single Class I study and 24 Class {IV} studies indicate that the benefits of anteromesial temporal lobe resection for disabling complex partial seizures is greater than continued treatment with antiepileptic drugs, and the risks are at least comparable. For patients who are compromised by such seizures, referral to an epilepsy surgery center should be strongly considered. Further studies are needed to determine if neocortical seizures benefit from surgery, and whether early surgical intervention should be the treatment of choice for certain surgically remediable epileptic syndromes.},

Here the regional distribution of selectively vulnerable neurons and the temporal evolution of such neuronal injury after status epilepticus ({SE}) are compared in both models. Using the silver staining technique of Gallyas, argyrophilic neurons were measured on a 0–3 (least-most) scale in 53 different brain areas. Few neurons were silver-stained 2.5 h after kainate-induced {SE}, but many silver-stained cells could be seen in most neocortical, hippocampal, amygdaloid and hypothalamic structures for pilocarpine group. In general, 8 or 24 h intervals between {SE} onset and perfusion times yielded the most intense neuronal silver-impregnation. Pilocarpine-induced neuronal silver impregnation was more prominent than that induced by kainate treatment for many areas in cortex, hippocampus, endopiriform nucleus, amygdaloid complex and hypothalamus. On the other hand, in the thalamus, some cortical areas, claustrum, lateral septum and caudoputamen, kainate-induced neuronal silver staining was also prominent, but occurred later than in pilocarpine-treated animals. Neuronal injury was found in almost the same brain areas in both models of {SE} but with different intensity levels and time course profiles. It was suggested that such differences in the temporal profile of cell damage should be taken into account when searching for neuroprotective agents.},

	abstract = {Summary:  Morphological and electrophysiological techiques were used to examine granule cells and their mossy fiber axons in nine surgically resected hippocampal specimens from temporal lobe epilepsy ({TLE}) patients. Timm histochemistry showed mossy fiber sprouting into the inner molecular layer ({IML}) of the dentate in a subset of tissue samples. In slices from five tissue samples, stimulus-induced bursting activity could be induced with a low concentration (2.5 μM) of bicuculline; bursts were sensitive to the N-methyl-d-aspartate ({NMDA}) blocker, {APV}. There was a general correlation between such sprouting and experimentally induced yperexcit ability. Fourteen granule cells from five tissue samples were intracellularly stained [with lucifer yellow ({LY}) or neurobiotin]. Axons from a subset of these neurons showed axon collaterals reaching into the {IML}, but this axon projection pattern for single cells was not directly correlated with degree of mossy fiber sprouting shown grossly by Timm staining. Electron microscopic examination of intracellularly stained elements showed mossy fiber axon terminals making asymmetric synaptic contacts (including autapses on the granule cell dendrite) with dendritic shafts and spines in both apical and basal domains. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that mossy fiber sprouting provides a structural basis for recurrent excitation of granule cells, but does not provide direct support of the hypothesis that mossy fiber sprouting causes hyperexcitability. The data suggest that granule cell bursting activity is at least in part a function of compromised synaptic inhibition, since levels of γ-aminobutyric acid ({GABA}) blockade that are generally subthreshold for burst induction were epileptogenic in some tissue samples from human epileptic hippocampus.},

	abstract = {It is widely believed that the theta rhythm in the hippocampus is caused by the rhythmic input from the medial septum-diagonal band of Broca ({MSDB}). The main {MSDB} output is formed by {GABAergic} projection neurons which are divided into two subpopulations and fire at different phases of the hippocampal theta rhythm. The {MSDB} also contains projection cholinergic, glutamatergic, and non-projection {GABAergic} neurons. These cell populations innervate each other and also {GABAergic} projection neurons and participate in the formation of the synchronous rhythmic output to the hippocampus. The purpose of this study is to work out a model of interactions between all neural populations of the {MSDB} that underlie the formation of the synchronous septal theta signal. The model is built from biologically plausible neurons of the Hodgkin-Huxley type and its architecture reflects modern data on the morphology of neural connections in the {MSDB}. The model satisfies the following requirements: (1) a large portion of neurons is fast-spiking; (2) the subpopulations of {GABAergic} projection neurons contain endogenous pacemaker neurons; (3) the phase shift of activity between subpopulations of {GABAergic} projection neurons is equal to about 150°; and (4) the strengths of bidirectional connections between the subpopulations of {GABAergic} projection cells are different. It is shown that the theta rhythm generation can be performed by a system of glutamatergic and {GABAergic} non-projection neurons. We also show that bursting pacemaker neurons in the subpopulation of projection {GABAergic} neurons play a significant role in the formation of stable antiphase outputs from the {MSDB} to the hippocampus.},

Epilepsy disturbs these brain rhythms and presumably therefore affects memory.

Here we review studies on cellular and systemic levels devoted to the {TLE}-induced disturbance of theta oscillations in the septohippocampal system. Special attention is paid to the role of damage of septal and hippocampal {GABAergic} cells in theta activity abnormalities. We also compare differences between native (in vivo) theta oscillations with those obtained in in vitro preparations of hippocampus and medial septum and find that in vitro they resemble epileptiform activity in some respects.},

Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ({nAChR}) subunits, α4β2 and α7 {nAChRs}, are expressed in {MSDB} neurons and permeable to calcium ions, which may modulate the function of {MSDB} neurons. The aims of this study are to determine the roles of selective {nAChR} activation on the calcium responses and membrane currents in {MSDB} neurons. Our results showed that nicotine increased calcium responses in the majority of {MSDB} neurons, pre-treatment of {MSDB} slices with a α4β2 {nAChR} antagonist, {DhβE} but not a α7 {nAChR} antagonist, {MLA} prevented nicotine-induced calcium responses. The whole cell patch clamp recordings showed that nicotine-induced inward current and acetylcholine ({ACh}) induced-firing activity can be largely reduced or prevented by {DhβE} in {MSDB} neurons. Surprisingly, post-treatment of α4β2 or α7 {nAChR} antagonists failed to block nicotine׳s role, they increased calcium responses instead. Application of calcium chelator {EGTA} reduced calcium responses in all neurons tested. These results suggest that there was a subtype specific modulation of {nAChRs} on calcium signaling and membrane currents in {MSDB} neurons and {nAChR} antagonists were also able to induce calcium responses involving a distinct mechanism.},

	abstract = {Aim: To examine whether co-activation of {nAChR} and {mGluR}1 induced γ oscillation (20–60 Hz) in rat medial septum diagonal band of Broca ({MSDB}) slices.
Methods: Rat brain sagittal slices containing the {MSDB} were prepared. Extracellular field potentials were recorded with glass microelectrodes. The {nAChR} and {mGluR}1 agonists were applied to the slices to induce network activity. Data analysis was performed off-line using software Spike 2.
Results: Co-application of the {nAChR} agonist nicotine (1 μmol/L) and the {mGluR}1 agonist dihydroxyphenylglycine ({DHPG}, 25 μmol/L) was able to induce γ oscillation in {MSDB} slices. The intensity of {nAChR} and {mGluR}1 activation was critical for induction of network oscillation at a low (θ oscillation) or high frequency (γ oscillation): co-application of low concentrations of the two agonists only increased the power and frequency of oscillation within the range of θ, whereas γ oscillation mostly appeared when high concentrations of the two agonists were applied.
Conclusion: Activation of {mGluR}1 and {nAChR} is able to program slow or fast network oscillation by altering the intensity of receptor activation, which may provide a mechanism for modulation of learning and memory.},

	abstract = {Aim:
Spiking activities and neuronal network oscillations in the theta frequency range have been found in many cortical areas during information processing. The aim of this study is to determine whether nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ({nAChRs}) mediate neuronal network activity in rat medial septum diagonal band Broca ({MSDB}) slices.

Methods:
Extracellular field potentials were recorded in the slices using an Axoprobe 1A amplifier. Data analysis was performed off-line. Spike sorting and local field potential ({LFP}) analyses were performed using Spike2 software. The role of spiking activity in the generation of {LFP} oscillations in the slices was determined by analyzing the phase-time relationship between the spikes and {LFP} oscillations. Circular statistic analysis based on the Rayleigh test was used to determine the significance of phase relationships between the spikes and {LFP} oscillations. The timing relationship was examined by quantifying the spike-field coherence ({SFC}).

Results:
Application of nicotine (250 nmol/L) induced prominent {LFP} oscillations in the theta frequency band and both small- and large-amplitude population spiking activity in the slices. These spikes were phase-locked to theta oscillations at specific phases. The Rayleigh test showed a statistically significant relationship in phase-locking between the spikes and theta oscillations. Larger changes in the {SFC} were observed for large-amplitude spikes, indicating an accurate timing relationship between this type of spike and {LFP} oscillations. The nicotine-induced spiking activity (large-amplitude population spikes) was suppressed by the {nAChR} antagonist dihydro-β-erythroidine (0.3 μmol/L).

Conclusion:
The results demonstrate that large-amplitude spikes are phase-locked to theta oscillations and have a high spike-timing accuracy, which are likely a main contributor to the theta oscillations generated in {MSDB} during nicotine receptor activation.},

	abstract = {Tonic impulse flow in the septohippocampal {GABAergic} pathway is essential for normal cognitive functioning and is sustained, in part, by acetylcholine ({ACh}) that is released locally via axon collaterals of septohippocampal cholinergic neurons. Septohippocampal cholinergic neurons degenerate in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. While the importance of the muscarinic effects of {ACh} on septohippocampal {GABAergic} neurons is well recognized, the nicotinic effects of {ACh} remain unstudied despite the reported benefits of nicotine on cognitive functioning. In the present study, using electrophysiological recordings in a rat brain slice preparation, rapid applications of nicotine excited 90\% of retrogradely labelled septohippocampal {GABA}-type neurons with an {EC}50 of 17 µm and increased the frequency of spontaneously occurring, impulse-dependent fast {GABAergic} and glutamatergic synaptic currents via the α4β2-nicotinic receptor. Interestingly, tetrodotoxin blocked all effects of nicotine on septohippocampal {GABAergic} type neurons, suggesting involvement of indirect mechanisms. We demonstrate that the effects of nicotine on septohippocampal {GABA}-type neurons involve recruitment of a novel, local glutamatergic circuitry as (i) Group I metabotropic glutamatergic receptor antagonists reduced the effects of nicotine; (ii) the number of nicotine responsive neurons was significantly reduced in recordings from slices that had been trimmed so as to reduce the number of glutamate-containing neurons within the slice preparation; (iii) in light and ultrastructural double immunocytochemical labelling studies vesicular glutamate 2 transporter immunoreactive terminals made synaptic contacts with parvalbumin-immunoreactive septohippocampal {GABAergic} neurons. The discovery of a local glutamatergic circuit within the septum may provide another avenue for restoring septohippocampal {GABAergic} functions in neurodegenerative disorders associated with a loss of septohippocampal cholinergic neurons.},

In recent years, many different methods have been proposed that typically compare the timing of spikes on a certain time scale to be optimized by the analyst. Here, we propose the {ISI}-distance, a simple complementary approach that extracts information from the interspike intervals by evaluating the ratio of the instantaneous firing rates. The method is parameter free, time scale independent and easy to visualize as illustrated by an application to real neuronal spike trains obtained in vitro from rat slices. In a comparison with existing approaches on spike trains extracted from a simulated Hindemarsh–Rose network, the {ISI}-distance performs as well as the best time-scale-optimized measure based on spike timing.},

These measures can broadly be divided in multivariate measures and averages over bivariate measures. One of the most recent bivariate approaches, the {ISI}-distance, employs the ratio of instantaneous interspike intervals ({ISIs}). In this study we propose two extensions of the {ISI}-distance, the straightforward averaged bivariate {ISI}-distance and the multivariate {ISI}-diversity based on the coefficient of variation. Like the original measure these extensions combine many properties desirable in applications to real data. In particular, they are parameter-free, time scale independent, and easy to visualize in a time-resolved manner, as we illustrate with in vitro recordings from a cortical neuron. Using a simulated network of Hindemarsh–Rose neurons as a controlled configuration we compare the performance of our methods in distinguishing different levels of multi-neuron spike train synchrony to the performance of six other previously published measures. We show and explain why the averaged bivariate measures perform better than the multivariate ones and why the multivariate {ISI}-diversity is the best performer among the multivariate methods. Finally, in a comparison against standard methods that rely on moving window estimates, we use single-unit monkey data to demonstrate the advantages of the instantaneous nature of our methods.},

	abstract = {In financial markets, it is both important and challenging to forecast the daily direction of the stock market return. Among the few studies that focus on predicting daily stock market returns, the data mining procedures utilized are either incomplete or inefficient, especially when a large amount of features are involved. This paper presents a complete and efficient data mining process to forecast the daily direction of the S\&P 500 Index {ETF} ({SPY}) return based on 60 financial and economic features. Three mature dimensionality reduction techniques, including principal component analysis ({PCA}), fuzzy robust principal component analysis ({FRPCA}), and kernel-based principal component analysis ({KPCA}) are applied to the whole data set to simplify and rearrange the original data structure. Corresponding to different levels of the dimensionality reduction, twelve new data sets are generated from the entire cleaned data using each of the three different dimensionality reduction methods. Artificial neural networks ({ANNs}) are then used with the thirty-six transformed data sets for classification to forecast the daily direction of future market returns. Moreover, the three different dimensionality reduction methods are compared with respect to the natural data set. A group of hypothesis tests are then performed over the classification and simulation results to show that combining the {ANNs} with the {PCA} gives slightly higher classification accuracy than the other two combinations, and that the trading strategies guided by the comprehensive classification mining procedures based on {PCA} and {ANNs} gain significantly higher risk-adjusted profits than the comparison benchmarks, while also being slightly higher than those strategies guided by the forecasts based on the {FRPCA} and {KPCA} models.},

	abstract = {In networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons with mutual synaptic coupling, specific drive to sub-ensembles of cells often leads to gamma-frequency (25–100 Hz) oscillations. When the number of driven cells is too small, however, the synaptic interactions may not be strong or homogeneous enough to support the mechanism underlying the rhythm. Using a combination of computational simulation and mathematical analysis, we study the breakdown of gamma rhythms as the driven ensembles become too small, or the synaptic interactions become too weak and heterogeneous. Heterogeneities in drives or synaptic strengths play an important role in the breakdown of the rhythms; nonetheless, we find that the analysis of homogeneous networks yields insight into the breakdown of rhythms in heterogeneous networks. In particular, if parameter values are such that in a homogeneous network, it takes several gamma cycles to converge to synchrony, then in a similar, but realistically heterogeneous network, synchrony breaks down altogether. This leads to the surprising conclusion that in a network with realistic heterogeneity, gamma rhythms based on the interaction of excitatory and inhibitory cell populations must arise either rapidly, or not at all. For given synaptic strengths and heterogeneities, there is a (soft) lower bound on the possible number of cells in an ensemble oscillating at gamma frequency, based simply on the requirement that synaptic interactions between the two cell populations be strong enough. This observation suggests explanations for recent experimental results concerning the modulation of gamma oscillations in macaque primary visual cortex by varying spatial stimulus size or attention level, and for our own experimental results, reported here, concerning the optogenetic modulation of gamma oscillations in kainate-activated hippocampal slices. We make specific predictions about the behavior of pyramidal cells and fast-spiking interneurons in these experiments., Gamma-frequency (25–100 Hz) oscillations in the brain often arise as a result of an interaction between excitatory and inhibitory cell populations. For this mechanism to work, the interaction must be sufficiently strong, and connectivity and external drives to participating neurons must be sufficiently homogeneous. As the interactions become weaker, either because the neuronal ensembles become smaller or because synapses weaken, the rhythms deteriorate, and eventually break down. This fact, by itself, is not surprising, but details of how the breakdown occurs are subtle. In particular, our analysis leads to the conclusion that in realistically heterogeneous networks, gamma rhythms must arise quickly, within a small number of oscillation periods, if they arise at all. Our findings suggest explanations for recent experimental findings concerning the minimal spatial extent of stimuli eliciting gamma oscillations in the primary visual cortex, the modulation of gamma oscillations in the primary visual cortex by attention, as well as our own experimental results, reported here, concerning the minimal light intensity below which optogenetic drive to pyramidal cells in a kainate-activated hippocampal slice results in disruption of an ongoing gamma oscillation. Our analysis leads to experimentally testable predictions about the behavior of the excitatory and inhibitory cells in these experiments.},

	abstract = {Multiple components of “γ-oscillations” between 30–170 Hz in the {CA}1 region of the hippocampus have been described, based on their coherence with oscillations in other brain regions and on their cross-frequency coupling with local θ-oscillations. However, it remains unclear whether the different sub-bands are generated by a single broadband oscillator coupled to multiple external inputs, or by separate oscillators that incorporate distinct circuit elements. To distinguish between these possibilities, we used high-density linear array recording electrodes in awake behaving mice to examine the spatiotemporal characteristics of γ-oscillations and their responses to midazolam and atropine. We characterized oscillations using current source density ({CSD}) analysis, and measured θ-γ phase-amplitude coupling by cross frequency coupling ({CFC}) analysis. Prominent peaks were present in the {CSD} signal in the mid- and distal apical dendritic layers at all frequencies, and at stratum pyramidale for γslow (30–45 Hz) and γmid (50–90 Hz), but not γfast (90–170 Hz) oscillations. Differences in the strength and timing of θ-γslow and θ-γmid cross frequency coupling, and a lack of coupling at the soma and mid-apical region for γfast oscillations, indicated that separate circuit components generate the three sub-bands. Midazolam altered {CSD} amplitudes and cross-frequency coupling in a lamina- and frequency specific manner, providing further evidence for separate generator circuits. Atropine altered {CSD} amplitudes and θ-γ {CFC} uniformly at all locations. Simulations using a detailed compartmental model were consistent with γslow and γmid oscillations driven primarily by inputs at the mid-apical dendrites, and γfast at the distal apical dendrite. Our results indicate that multiple distinct local circuits generate γ-oscillations in the {CA}1 region of the hippocampus, and provide detailed information about their spatiotemporal characteristics.},

	abstract = {During active exploration, hippocampal neurons exhibit nested rhythmic activity at theta (≈8 Hz) and gamma (≈40 Hz) frequencies. Gamma rhythms may be generated locally by interactions within a class of interneurons mediating fast {GABAA} ({GABAA},fast) inhibitory postsynaptic currents ({IPSCs}), whereas theta rhythms traditionally are thought to be imposed extrinsically. However, the hippocampus contains slow biophysical mechanisms that may contribute to the theta rhythm, either as a resonance activated by extrinsic input or as a purely local phenomenon. For example, region {CA}1 of the hippocampus contains a slower class of {GABAA} ({GABAA},slow) synapses, believed to be generated by a distinct group of interneurons. Recent evidence indicates that these {GABAA},slow interneurons project to the {GABAA},fast interneurons that contribute to hippocampal gamma rhythms. Here, we use biophysically based simulations to explore the possible ramifications of interneuronal circuits containing separate classes of {GABAA},fast and {GABAA},slow interneurons. Simulated interneuronal networks with fast and slow synaptic kinetics can generate mixed theta-gamma rhythmicity under restricted conditions, including strong connections among each population, weaker connections between the two populations, and homogeneity of cellular properties and drive. Under a broader range of conditions, including heterogeneity, the networks can amplify and resynchronize phasic responses to weak phase-dispersed external drive at theta frequencies to either {GABAA},slow or {GABAA},fast cells. {GABAA},slow synapses are necessary for this process of amplification and resynchronization.},

	abstract = {Glucose is the main energy substrate in the adult brain under normal conditions. Accumulating evidence, however, indicates that lactate produced in astrocytes (a type of glial cell) can also fuel neuronal activity. The quantitative aspects of this so-called astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle ({ANLS}) are still debated. To address this question, we developed a detailed biophysical model of the brain’s metabolic interactions. Our model integrates three modeling approaches, the Buxton-Wang model of vascular dynamics, the Hodgkin-Huxley formulation of neuronal membrane excitability and a biophysical model of metabolic pathways. This approach provides a template for large-scale simulations of the neuron-glia-vasculature ({NGV}) ensemble, and for the first time integrates the respective timescales at which energy metabolism and neuronal excitability occur. The model is constrained by relative neuronal and astrocytic oxygen and glucose utilization, by the concentration of metabolites at rest and by the temporal dynamics of {NADH} upon activation. These constraints produced four observations. First, a transfer of lactate from astrocytes to neurons emerged in response to activity. Second, constrained by activity-dependent {NADH} transients, neuronal oxidative metabolism increased first upon activation with a subsequent delayed astrocytic glycolysis increase. Third, the model correctly predicted the dynamics of extracellular lactate and oxygen as observed in vivo in rats. Fourth, the model correctly predicted the temporal dynamics of tissue lactate, of tissue glucose and oxygen consumption, and of the {BOLD} signal as reported in human studies. These findings not only support the {ANLS} hypothesis but also provide a quantitative mathematical description of the metabolic activation in neurons and glial cells, as well as of the macroscopic measurements obtained during brain imaging., The brain has remarkable information processing capacity, yet is also very energy efficient. How this metabolic efficiency is achieved given the spatial and metabolic constraints inherent to the designs and energy requirements of brain cells is a fundamental question in neurobiology. The major cell classes in mammalian nervous systems include neurons, glia and the microvasculature that supplies the molecular substrates of energy and metabolism. Together, this neuron-glia-vasculature ({NGV}) ensemble constitutes the functional unit that underlies the cost infrastructure of computation. In spite of its importance, a comprehensive understanding of this dynamic system remains elusive. While it is well established that glucose feeds the brain, few of the details regarding the destiny of glucose intermediates in metabolic pathways are known. Controversy remains regarding the degree of cooperativity between glia and neurons in sharing lactate, the product of aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) and one of the substrates for further energy extraction by oxidative processes. Specifically, while experimental data support the occurrence of a flow of lactate from glia to neurons, the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle ({ANLS}), some theoretical considerations have been proposed to support the occurrence of lactate transport in the other direction ({NALS}). Our computational model is the first to integrate multiple timescales of the {NGV} unit. It provides a quantitative mathematical description of metabolic activation in neurons and astrocytes, and of the macroscopic measurements obtained during brain imaging that uses metabolism as a proxy for neuronal activity.},

Stimulation-induced transient changes in {NAD}(P)H fluorescence intensity frequently display a biphasic characteristic that is influenced by various molecular processes, e.g., intracellular calcium dynamics, tricarboxylic acid cycle activity, the malate–aspartate shuttle, the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle, oxygen supply or adenosine triphosphate ({ATP}) demand. To evaluate the relative impact of these processes, we developed and validated a detailed physiologic mathematical model of the energy metabolism of neuronal cells and used the model to simulate metabolic changes of single cells and tissue slices under different settings of stimulus-induced activity and varying nutritional supply of glucose, pyruvate or lactate. Notably, all experimentally determined {NAD}(P)H responses could be reproduced with one and the same generic cellular model. Our computations reveal that (1) cells with quite different metabolic status may generate almost identical {NAD}(P)H responses and (2) cells of the same type may quite differently contribute to aggregate {NAD}(P)H responses recorded in brain slices, depending on the spatial location within the tissue. Our computational approach reconciles different and sometimes even controversial experimental findings and improves our mechanistic understanding of the metabolic changes underlying live-cell {NAD}(P)H fluorescence transients.},

	abstract = {Ferroptosis is a recently recognized form of regulated cell death. It is characterized morphologically by the presence of smaller than normal mitochondria with condensed mitochondrial membrane densities, reduction or vanishing of mitochondria crista, and outer mitochondrial membrane rupture. It can be induced by experimental compounds (e.g., erastin, Ras-selective lethal small molecule 3, and buthionine sulfoximine) or clinical drugs (e.g., sulfasalazine, sorafenib, and artesunate) in cancer cells and certain normal cells (e.g., kidney tubule cells, neurons, fibroblasts, and T cells). Activation of mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels and mitogen-activated protein kinases, upregulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress, and inhibition of cystine/glutamate antiporter is involved in the induction of ferroptosis. This process is characterized by the accumulation of lipid peroxidation products and lethal reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) derived from iron metabolism and can be pharmacologically inhibited by iron chelators (e.g., deferoxamine and desferrioxamine mesylate) and lipid peroxidation inhibitors (e.g., ferrostatin, liproxstatin, and zileuton). Glutathione peroxidase 4, heat shock protein beta-1, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 function as negative regulators of ferroptosis by limiting {ROS} production and reducing cellular iron uptake, respectively. In contrast, {NADPH} oxidase and p53 (especially acetylation-defective mutant p53) act as positive regulators of ferroptosis by promotion of {ROS} production and inhibition of expression of {SLC}7A11 (a specific light-chain subunit of the cystine/glutamate antiporter), respectively. Misregulated ferroptosis has been implicated in multiple physiological and pathological processes, including cancer cell death, neurotoxicity, neurodegenerative diseases, acute renal failure, drug-induced hepatotoxicity, hepatic and heart ischemia/reperfusion injury, and T-cell immunity.

An elaboration of cell death pathways thus will contribute to a better understanding of cancer pathogenesis and therapeutics. With the recent substantial biochemical and genetic explorations of cell death subroutines, their classification has switched from primarily morphological to more molecular definitions. According to their measurable biochemical features and intricate mechanisms, cell death subroutines can be divided into apoptosis, autophagic cell death, mitotic catastrophe, necroptosis, parthanatos, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, pyronecrosis, anoikis, cornification, entosis, and {NETosis}. Supportive evidence has gradually revealed the prime molecular mechanisms of each subroutine and thus providing series of possible targets in cancer therapy, while the intricate relationships between different cell death subroutines still remain to be clarified. Over the past decades, cancer drug discovery has significantly benefited from the use of small-molecule compounds to target classical modalities of cell death such as apoptosis, while newly identified cell death subroutines has also emerging their potential for cancer drug discovery in recent years. In this review, we comprehensively focus on summarizing 12 cell death subroutines and discussing their corresponding small-molecule compounds in potential cancer therapy. Together, these inspiring findings may provide more evidence to fill in the gaps between cell death subroutines and small-molecule compounds to better develop novel cancer therapeutic strategies.},

	abstract = {Ferroptosis is a newly discovered type of cell death that differs from traditional apoptosis and necrosis and results from iron‐dependent lipid peroxide accumulation. Ferroptotic cell death is characterized by cytological changes, including cell volume shrinkage and increased mitochondrial membrane density. Ferroptosis can be induced by two classes of small‐molecule substances known as class 1 (system X
c
− inhibitors) and class 2 ferroptosis inducers [glutathione peroxidase 4 ({GPx}4) inhibitors]. In addition to these small‐molecule substances, a number of drugs (e.g. sorafenib, artemisinin and its derivatives) can induce ferroptosis. Various factors, such as the mevalonate ({MVA}) and sulphur‐transfer pathways, play pivotal roles in the regulation of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis plays an unneglectable role in regulating the growth and proliferation of some types of tumour cells, such as lymphocytoma, ductal cell cancer of the pancreas, renal cell carcinoma ({RCC}) and hepatocellular carcinoma ({HCC}). Here, we will first introduce the discovery of and research pertaining to ferroptosis; then summarize the induction mechanisms and regulatory pathways of ferroptosis; and finally, further elucidate the roles of ferroptosis in human tumourous diseases.},

Here we show that p53 inhibits cystine uptake and sensitizes cells to ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of cell death, by repressing expression of {SLC}7A11, a key component of the cystine/glutamate antiporter. Notably, p533KR, an acetylation-defective mutant that fails to induce cell-cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis, fully retains the ability to regulate {SLC}7A11 expression and induce ferroptosis upon reactive oxygen species ({ROS})-induced stress. Analysis of mutant mice shows that these non-canonical p53 activities contribute to embryonic development and the lethality associated with loss of Mdm2. Moreover, {SLC}7A11 is highly expressed in human tumours, and its overexpression inhibits {ROS}-induced ferroptosis and abrogates p533KR-mediated tumour growth suppression in xenograft models. Our findings uncover a new mode of tumour suppression based on p53 regulation of cystine metabolism, {ROS} responses and ferroptosis.},

	abstract = {Background
While the deregulation of iron homeostasis in breast epithelial cells is acknowledged, iron-related alterations in stromal inflammatory cells from the tumor microenvironment have not been explored.

Methods
Immunohistochemistry for hepcidin, ferroportin 1 ({FPN}1), transferrin receptor 1 ({TFR}1) and ferritin ({FT}) was performed in primary breast tissues and axillary lymph nodes in order to dissect the iron-profiles of epithelial cells, lymphocytes and macrophages. Furthermore, breast carcinoma core biopsies frozen in optimum cutting temperature ({OCT}) compound were subjected to imaging flow cytometry to confirm {FPN}1 expression in the cell types previously evaluated and determine its cellular localization.

Results
We confirm previous results by showing that breast cancer epithelial cells present an ‘iron-utilization phenotype’ with an increased expression of hepcidin and {TFR}1, and decreased expression of {FT}. On the other hand, lymphocytes and macrophages infiltrating primary tumors and from metastized lymph nodes display an ‘iron-donor’ phenotype, with increased expression of {FPN}1 and {FT}, concomitant with an activation profile reflected by a higher expression of {TFR}1 and hepcidin. A higher percentage of breast carcinomas, compared to control mastectomy samples, present iron accumulation in stromal inflammatory cells, suggesting that these cells may constitute an effective tissue iron reservoir. Additionally, not only the deregulated expression of iron-related proteins in epithelial cells, but also on lymphocytes and macrophages, are associated with clinicopathological markers of breast cancer poor prognosis, such as negative hormone receptor status and tumor size.

Conclusions
The present results reinforce the importance of analyzing the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer, extending the contribution of immune cells to local iron homeostasis in the tumor microenvironment context.},

	abstract = {Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent, oxidative cell death, and is distinct from apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy.

Furthermore, the iron chelator deferoxamine ({DFO}) significantly reduced cytosolic {ROS} and cell death following treatment with siramesine and lapatinib. Furthermore, we determined that {FeCl}3 levels were elevated in cells treated with siramesine and lapatinib indicating an iron-dependent cell death, ferroptosis. To confirm this, we treated cells with a potent inhibitor of ferroptosis, ferrastatin-1 that effectively inhibited cell death following siramesine and lapatinib treatment. The increase levels of iron could be due to changes in iron transport. We found that the expression of transferrin, which is responsible for the transport of iron into cells, is increased following treatment with lapatinib alone or in combination with siramesine. Knocking down of transferrin resulted in decreased cell death and {ROS} after treatment. In addition, ferroportin-1 ({FPN}) is an iron transport protein, responsible for removal of iron from cells. We found its expression is decreased after treatment with siramesine alone or in combination with lapatinib. Overexpression {FPN} resulted in decreased {ROS} and cell death whereas knockdown of {FPN} increased cell death after siramesine and lapatinib treatment. This indicates a novel induction of ferroptosis through altered iron regulation by treating breast cancer cells with a lysosome disruptor and a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.},

Isothermal titration calorimetric and kinetic measurements of Zn({II}) and Tb({III}) binding and inhibition of Fe({II}) oxidation were used to identify and characterize thermodynamically ( n, K, Delta H degrees, Delta S degrees, and Delta G degrees ) the functionally important binding sites for these metal ions in recombinant human H-chain, L-chain, and H-chain site-directed variant ferritins. The data reveal at least two classes of binding sites for both Zn({II}) and Tb({III}) in human H-chain ferritin: one strong, corresponding to binding of one metal ion in each of the eight three-fold channels, and the other weak, involving binding at the ferroxidase and nucleation sites of the protein as well as at other weak unidentified binding sites. Zn({II}) and Tb({III}) binding to recombinant L-chain ferritin showed similar stoichiometries for the strong binding sites within the channels, but fewer weaker binding sites when compared to the H-chain protein. The kinetics and binding data indicate that the binding of Zn({II}) and Tb({III}) in the three-fold channels, which is the main pathway of iron({II}) entry in ferritin, blocks the access of most of the iron to the ferroxidase sites on the interior of the protein, accounting for the strong inhibition by these metal ions of the oxidative deposition of iron in ferritin.},

	abstract = {Background
Traditional cancer therapy can be successful in destroying tumors, but can also cause dangerous side effects. Therefore, many targeted therapies are in development. The transferrin receptor ({TfR}) functions in cellular iron uptake through its interaction with transferrin. This receptor is an attractive molecule for the targeted therapy of cancer since it is upregulated on the surface of many cancer types and is efficiently internalized. This receptor can be targeted in two ways: 1) for the delivery of therapeutic molecules into malignant cells or 2) to block the natural function of the receptor leading directly to cancer cell death.

Scope of review
In the present article we discuss the strategies used to target the {TfR} for the delivery of therapeutic agents into cancer cells. We provide a summary of the vast types of anti-cancer drugs that have been delivered into cancer cells employing a variety of receptor binding molecules including Tf, anti-{TfR} antibodies, or {TfR}-binding peptides alone or in combination with carrier molecules including nanoparticles and viruses.

Major conclusions
Targeting the {TfR} has been shown to be effective in delivering many different therapeutic agents and causing cytotoxic effects in cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.

General significance
The extensive use of {TfR} for targeted therapy attests to the versatility of targeting this receptor for therapeutic purposes against malignant cells. More advances in this area are expected to further improve the therapeutic potential of targeting the {TfR} for cancer therapy leading to an increase in the number of clinical trials of molecules targeting this receptor.},

The majority of single {MSDB} cells (60\%) were significantly suppressed during {SPWs}. Most cells inhibited during {SPW} (80\%) fired rhythmically and phase-locked to the negative peak of the {CA}1 pyramidal layer theta waves. Because both {SPW} and the negative peak of local theta waves correspond to the maximum discharge probability of {CA}1 pyramidal cells and interneuron classes, the findings indicate that the activity of medial septal neurons can be negatively (during {SPW}) or positively (during theta waves) correlated with the activity of hippocampal interneurons.

	abstract = {Summary
Gamma-frequency oscillations ({GFOs}, \&gt;40 Hz) are a general network signature at seizure onset at all stages of development, with possible deleterious consequences in the immature brain. At early developmental stages, the simultaneous occurrence of {GFOs} in different brain regions suggests the existence of a long-ranging synchronizing mechanism at seizure onset. Here, we show that hippocamposeptal ({HS}) neurons, which are {GABA} long-range projection neurons, are mandatory to drive the firing of hippocampal interneurons in a high-frequency regime at the onset of epileptiform discharges in the intact, immature septohippocampal formation. The synchronized firing of interneurons in turn produces {GFOs}, which are abolished after the elimination of a small number of {HS} neurons. Because they provide the necessary fast conduit for pacing large neuronal populations and display intra- and extrahippocampal long-range projections, {HS} neurons appear to belong to the class of hub cells that play a crucial role in the synchronization of developing networks.},

	abstract = {The medial septum diagonal band area ({MS}/{DB}) projects to the hippocampus through the fornix/fimbria pathway and is implicated in generating hippocampal theta oscillations. The hippocampus also projects back to the {MS}/{DB}, but very little is known functionally about this input. Here, we investigated the physiological role of hippocamposeptal feedback to the {MS}/{DB} in a complete in vitro septohippocampal preparation containing the intact interconnecting fornix/fimbria pathway. We demonstrated that carbachol-induced rhythmic theta-like hippocampal oscillations recorded extracellularly were synchronized with powerful rhythmic {IPSPs} in whole-cell recorded {MS}/{DB} neurons. Interestingly, we found that these {IPSPs} evoked rebound spiking in {GABAergic} {MS}/{DB} neurons. In contrast, putative cholinergic and glutamatergic {MS}/{DB} neurons responded only weakly with rebound spiking and, as a result, were mostly silent during theta-like oscillations. We next determined the mechanism underlying the rebound spiking that followed the {IPSPs} in {MS}/{DB} {GABAergic} neurons using phasic electrical stimulation of the fornix/fimbria pathway. We demonstrate that the increased rebound spiking was attributable to the activation of Ih current, because it was significantly reduced by low concentrations of the Ih antagonist {ZD}7288 [4-(N-ethyl-N-phenylamino)-1,2-dimethyl-6-(methylamino) pyridinium chloride]. Together, these results suggest that rhythmical activity in hippocampus is transferred to the {MS}/{DB} and can preferentially phase the spiking of {GABAergic} {MS}/{DB} neurons because of their significant expression of Ih currents. Our data demonstrate that hippocamposeptal inhibition facilitates theta rhythmic discharges in {MS}/{DB} {GABAergic} neurons while favoring the inhibition of most {ACh} and glutamate neurons.},

	abstract = {The morphological properties and connectivity of γ-aminobutyric acid ({GABA})ergic hippocampal cells projecting to the medial septum ({HS} cells) were examined in the rat. Two types of {HS} cells are located in different layers of the hippocampus: sparsely-spiny cells are in {CA}1–3 str. oriens and {CA}3 str. radiatum, where recurrent axons of pyramidal cells arborize. Densely-spiny {HS} cells with spiny somata are located in the termination zone of granule cell axons. In the hilus, intermediate morphologies can also be found. {HS} cells receive {GABAergic} medial septal afferents in all layers where they occur, thus the connectivity of the septum and the hippocampus is reciprocal at cell level. {HS} cells receive extremely dense innervation, sparsely-spiny cells are innervated by ∼19 000 excitatory inputs, while densely-spiny cells get an even larger number (∼37 000). While 14\% of the inputs are inhibitory for the sparsely-spiny cells, it is only 2.3\% in the case of densely-spiny cells. Because a high proportion (up to 54.5\% on somata and 27.5\% on dendrites) of their {GABAergic} inputs derived from labelled septal terminals, their predominant inhibitory input probably arises from the medial septum. {CA}1 area {HS} cells possessed myelinated projecting axons, as well as local collaterals, which targeted mostly pyramidal cell dendrites and spines in str. oriens and radiatum. The synaptic organization suggests that by sampling the activity of large populations of principal cells {HS} cells can reliably broadcast hippocampal activity level to the medial septum.},

Electron microscopic analysis showed that the majority of the anterogradely labeled boutons formed symmetric synapses with dendrites and occasionally with cell bodies located in the medial septum-diagonal band of Broca complex. We have demonstrated with postembedding {GABA} immunocytochemistry that the majority of {PHAL}-labeled axon terminals were {GABAergic}. The neurochemical character of the postsynaptic target cells was also investigated using immunocytochemical double staining. Our data showed that the majority of the labeled hippocamposeptal axons innervated parvalbumin-immunoreactive cells representing {GABAergic} projection neurons, and a smaller number of contacts were found on {ChAT}-positive neurons. Septohippocampal neurons identified by retrograde {HRP} transport were also shown to reactive direct hippocamposeptal input. According to recent results, the lateral septum is unlikely to relay the hippocampal feedback to the medial septum; therefore, the direct hippocampal projection to the medial septum, arising from {GABAergic} nonpyramidal cells, seems to be the only feedback pathway to the area containing septohippocampal neurons. A novel circuit diagram, based on our recent morphological-immunocytochemical findings, is shown for the synaptic organization of the septo-hippocampo-septal loop. We suggest that the {GABAergic} hippocamposeptal feedback controls the activity of septal (mostly {GABAergic}) projection neurons as a function of hippocampal synchrony. The newly discovered reciprocal interactions may give a better insight into septohippocampal physiology.},

Given their critical roles in shaping brain output, it is important to try to understand the functionality of their computational characteristics. To do this, we focus on specific interneuron subtypes. In particular, it has recently been shown that long-term potentiation is induced specifically on oriens-lacunosum/moleculare (O-{LM}) interneurons in hippocampus {CA}1 and that the same cells contain the highest density of dendritic sodium and potassium conductances measured to date. We have created multi-compartment models of an O-{LM} hippocampal interneuron using passive properties, channel kinetics, densities and distributions specific to this cell type, and explored its signalling characteristics. We found that spike initiation depends on both location and amount of input, as well as the intrinsic properties of the interneuron. Distal synaptic input always produces strong back-propagating spikes whereas proximal input could produce both forward- and back-propagating spikes depending on the input strength. We speculate that the highly active dendrites of these interneurons endow them with a specialized function within the hippocampal circuitry by allowing them to regulate direct and indirect signalling pathways within the hippocampus.},

The Hodgkin-Huxley model established a framework in which to describe the structural and functional properties of ion channels, including the mechanisms of ion permeation, selectivity, and gating. At a cellular level, the model is used to understand the conditions that control both the rate and timing of action potentials, essential for neural encoding of information.

Large research groups (Allen Brain Institute, {EU} Human Brain Project, etc.) are emerging that collect data across multiple scales and integrate that data into many complex models, presenting new challenges of scale.

	abstract = {Synchronization of neuronal network oscillations within the cortex and hippocampus has been closely linked to various cognitive domains, including attention, learning, and memory. The frequency, power, and connectivity of hippocampal oscillations provide quantitative measures for examining the modulation of network activity, which influences mnemonic functions and memory formation. The wide distribution of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7 {nAChRs}) throughout the hippocampus makes them well positioned to modulate neuronal network activity. Elicitation of hippocampal theta through high frequency stimulation of the brainstem nucleus pontis oralis ({nPO}) is shown to be sensitive to several agents exhibiting pharmacological effects on cognition, thus representing a suitable preclinical screening assay for such drugs, including α7 {nAChR} agonists. We hypothesize that increases in theta power and theta-phase gamma-amplitude coupling due to α7 {nAChR} agonists during elicited hippocampal oscillations could reflect changes in synchronous activity of pyramidal neurons which is a critical factor for hippocampal-dependent cognitive function. In this review, four major topics are discussed: neuronal network oscillations in the hippocampus, the characteristics and distribution of α7 {nAChRs} therein, the modulation of elicited hippocampal theta and gamma oscillations by α7 {nAChR} agonists, as well as potential intrinsic roles of α7 {nAChRs} in hippocampal oscillations using α7 {nAChR} knock-out mice.},

	abstract = {Inhibitory postsynaptic currents mediated by spontaneous activation of {GABAA} receptors were studied using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in granule cells of the adult rat (postnatal day 60+) dentate gyrus in 400-μm-thick coronal half-brain slices maintained at 34–35°C. The average amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents remained constant during a given recording period (i.e. no rundown was noted). The spontaneous currents had an average conductance between 200–400 {pS}, were mediated by Cl− flux through {GABAA} receptor/channels since they reversed at the Cl− equilibrium potential and were blocked by bicuculline or picrotoxin. Their mono-exponential decay time-constants (range: 4.2–7.2 ms) were prolonged by midazolam and pentobarbital in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of midazolam was reversed by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil ({RO} 15–1788) which, by itself, had no effect on the decay time-constant. The decay time-constant was also dependent on membrane voltage and on temperature. A 132-{mV} change in membrane potential produced an e-fold prolongation of the decay while the Q10 (between 22–37°C) of the decay rate was 2.1. Within a given neuron, the frequency of spontaneous {GABAergic} events was remarkably constant over long time-periods, though the mean frequency among different cells showed large variability. Spontaneous miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents also persisted under experimental conditions such as the presence of extracellular tetrodotoxin (1 μM), Cd2+ (200 μM) or lowered extracellular Ca2+/elevated Mg2+, which effectively abolished all stimulus-evoked {GABAergic} neurotransmission. The frequency of tetrodotoxin-resistant miniature events was increased by elevating extracellular K+ concentration and was diminished by the {GABAB} receptor agonist (−)baclofen only at a dose (50 μM) which was an order of magnitude larger than that required to depress stimulus-evoked responses.
These findings are consistent with different mechanisms being responsible for the spontaneous and stimulus-evoked release of {GABA} from interneuron terminals and also identify pre- and postsynaptic modulatory factors of the endogenous, action-potential-independent, {GABAergic} neurotransmission as being important determinants of the excitability level of mammalian {CNS} neurons.},

	abstract = {Excitatory postsynaptic currents ({EPSCs}) in most mammalian central neurons have a fast α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoazole-proprionic acid ({AMPA}) receptor-mediated component, lasting a few milliseconds, and a slow N-methyl-d-aspartic acid ({NMDA})-receptor-mediated component, lasting hundreds of milliseconds. The time course of the {AMPA} phase is crucial in the integrative function of neurons, but measuring it accurately is often confounded by cable filtering between the recording electrode and the synapse. We describe a method for recovering the {AMPA} phase of individual {EPSCs} by determining the impulse response of the cable filter from single {NMDA} channel transitions in the slow tails of the same {EPSC}, then deconvolving the measured {AMPA} current. Using simulations, we show that filtering of an {AMPA} conductance transient in a voltage-clamped dendrite behaves in an almost perfectly linear fashion. Expressions are derived for the time course of single channel transitions and the {AMPA} phase filtered through a voltage-clamped cable or a single exponential filter, using a kinetic model for {AMPA} receptor activation. Fitting these expressions to experimental records directly estimates the underlying kinetics of the {AMPA} phase. Example measurements of spontaneous {EPSCs} in cultured nonpyramidal rat cortical neurons yielded rising time constants of 0.2–0.8 ms, and decay time constants of 1.3–2 ms at 23–25°C.},

Based on the computational proposal that the dentate gyrus produces sparse representations by competitive learning and via the mossy fiber pathway forces new representations on the {CA}3 during learning (encoding), it has been shown behaviorally that the dentate gyrus supports spatial pattern separation during learning. Based on the computational proposal that {CA}3–{CA}3 autoassociative networks are important for episodic memory, it has been shown behaviorally that the {CA}3 supports spatial rapid one-trial learning, learning of arbitrary associations where space is a component, pattern completion, spatial short-term memory, and spatial sequence learning by associations formed between successive items. The concept that the {CA}1 recodes information from {CA}3 and sets up associatively learned backprojections to neocortex to allow subsequent retrieval of information to neocortex, is consistent with findings on consolidation. Behaviorally, the {CA}1 is implicated in processing temporal information as shown by investigations requiring temporal order pattern separation and associations across time; and computationally this could involve associations in {CA}1 between object and timing information that have their origins in the lateral and medial entorhinal cortex respectively. The perforant path input from the entorhinal cortex to {DG} is implicated in learning, to {CA}3 in retrieval from {CA}3, and to {CA}1 in retrieval after longer time intervals (“intermediate-term memory”) and in the temporal sequence memory for objects.},

	abstract = {Summary
Before the onset of locomotion, the hippocampus undergoes a transition into an activity-state specialized for the processing of spatially related input. This brain-state transition is associated with increased firing rates of {CA}1 pyramidal neurons and the occurrence of theta oscillations, which both correlate with locomotion velocity. However, the neural circuit by which locomotor activity is linked to hippocampal oscillations and neuronal firing rates is unresolved. Here we reveal a septo-hippocampal circuit mediated by glutamatergic ({VGluT}2+) neurons that is activated before locomotion onset and that controls the initiation and velocity of locomotion as well as the entrainment of theta oscillations. Moreover, via septo-hippocampal projections onto alveus/oriens interneurons, this circuit regulates feedforward inhibition of Schaffer collateral and perforant path input to {CA}1 pyramidal neurons in a locomotion-dependent manner. With higher locomotion speed, the increased activity of medial septal {VGluT}2 neurons is translated into increased axo-somatic depolarization and higher firing rates of {CA}1 pyramidal neurons.

However, recent evidence suggests that successful memory performance also requires coupling of ∼30–100 Hz gamma rhythms to particular phases of the theta cycle. Recent insights imply ways in which theta–gamma coupling may facilitate transfer of information throughout the entorhinal–hippocampal network. Activating gamma-modulated cell assemblies at a particular theta phase may allow the network to produce a more powerful output by ensuring that distributed cells fire closely in time. I hypothesize that such a mechanism would serve to facilitate either memory encoding or memory retrieval, depending on which type of gamma rhythms are recruited.},

Lesions that block theta rhythm impair performance in tasks requiring reversalofpriorlearning, {includingreversalinaT}-maze, whereassociations between one arm location and food reward need to be extinguished in favor of associations between the opposite arm location and food reward. Here, a hippocampal model shows how theta rhythm could be important for reversal in this task by providing separate functional phases during each 100-300 msec cycle, consistent with physiological data. In the model, effective encoding of new associations occurs in the phase when synaptic input from entorhinal cortex is strong and long-term potentiation ({LTP}) of excitatory connections arising from hippocampal region {CA}3 is strong, but synaptic currents arising from region {CA}3 input are weak (to prevent interference from prior learned associations). Retrieval of old associations occurs in the phase when entorhinal input is weak and synaptic input from region {CA}3 is strong, but when depotentiation occurs at synapses from {CA}3 (to allow extinction of prior learned associations that do not match current input). These phasic changes require that {LTP} at synapses arising from region {CA}3 should be strongest at the phase when synaptic transmission at these synapses is weakest. Consistent with these requirements, our recent data show that synaptic transmission in stratum radiatum is weakest at the positive peak of local theta, which is when previous data show that induction of {LTP} is strongest in this layer.},

	abstract = {The {CA}3 and {CA}1 pyramidal neurons are the major principal cell types of the hippocampus proper. The strongly recurrent collateral system of {CA}3 cells and the largely parallel-organized {CA}1 neurons suggest that these regions perform distinct computations. However, a comprehensive comparison between {CA}1 and {CA}3 pyramidal cells in terms of firing properties, network dynamics, and behavioral correlations is sparse in the intact animal. We performed large-scale recordings in the dorsal hippocampus of rats to quantify the similarities and differences between {CA}1 (n {\textgreater} 3,600) and {CA}3 (n {\textgreater} 2,200) pyramidal cells during sleep and exploration in multiple environments. {CA}1 and {CA}3 neurons differed significantly in firing rates, spike burst propensity, spike entrainment by the theta rhythm, and other aspects of spiking dynamics in a brain state-dependent manner. A smaller proportion of {CA}3 than {CA}1 cells displayed prominent place fields, but place fields of {CA}3 neurons were more compact, more stable, and carried more spatial information per spike than those of {CA}1 pyramidal cells. Several other features of the two cell types were specific to the testing environment. {CA}3 neurons showed less pronounced phase precession and a weaker position versus spike-phase relationship than {CA}1 cells. Our findings suggest that these distinct activity dynamics of {CA}1 and {CA}3 pyramidal cells support their distinct computational roles.},

The hippocampal system has been postulated to have two (or more) rhythmic sources of theta oscillations, but little is known about the behavior-dependent interplay of theta oscillations in different subregions and layers of the hippocampus. We tested rats in a hippocampus-dependent delayed spatial alternation task on a modified T-maze while simultaneously recording local field potentials from dendritic and somatic layers of the dentate gyrus, {CA}3, and {CA}1 regions using high-density, 96-site silicon probes. We found that while theta oscillations were generally coherent throughout the hippocampus, the power, coherence, and phase of theta oscillations fluctuated in a layer-specific manner, confirming the presence of multiple interdependent dipoles. Layer-dependent changes in the power and coherence of theta oscillations varied with aspects of both the memory and control (non-mnemonic) tasks, but only a small fraction of the variance could be explained by running speed or acceleration. Furthermore, the phase lag between theta oscillations in the {CA}3 and {CA}1 pyramidal layers was significantly smaller on the maze arm approaching the T-junction than on other arms of the alternation task or on comparable segments of control tasks. Overall, our findings reveal a consortium of layer-specific theta dipoles (current sinks and sources) generated by the rhythmic flow of ions into and out of hippocampal cells. Moreover, our data suggest that these different theta generators flexibly coordinate hippocampal regions and layers to support behavioral task performance.},

However, the exact computational role of the population of grid cells is not known. Here we provide a descriptive model, which nonetheless considers biologically feasible mechanisms, whereby the grid cells are viewed as a two-dimensional Fourier basis set, in hexagonal coordinates, with restricted availability of basis functions. With known properties imposed into the model parameters, we demonstrate how various empirical benchmark ﬁndings are straight-forward to understand in this model. We also explain how complex computations, inherent in a Fourier model, are feasible in the medial entorhinal cortex with simple mechanisms. We further suggest, based on model experiments, that grid cells may support a form of lossy compression of contextual information, enabling its representation in an eﬃcient manner. In sum, this hexagonal Fourier model suggests how the entire population of grid cells may be modelled in a principled way, incorporates biologically feasible mechanisms and provides a potentially powerful interpretation of the relationship between grid-cell activity and contextual information beyond spatial knowledge. This enables various phenomena to be modelled with relatively simple mechanisms, and leads to novel and testable predictions.},

	abstract = {Place cells in the hippocampus and grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex have different codes for space. However, how one code relates to the other is ill understood. Based on the anatomy of the entorhinal-hippocampal circuitry, we constructed a model of place and grid cells organized in a loop to investigate their mutual influence in the establishment of their codes for space. Using computer simulations, we first replicated experiments in rats that measured place and grid cell activity in different environments, and then assessed which features of the model account for different phenomena observed in neurophysiological data, such as pattern completion and pattern separation, global and rate remapping of place cells, and realignment of grid cells. We found that (1) the interaction between grid and place cells converges quickly; (2) the spatial code of place cells does not require, but is altered by, grid cell input; (3) plasticity in sensory inputs to place cells is key for pattern completion but not pattern separation; (4) grid realignment can be explained in terms of place cell remapping as opposed to the other way around; (5) the switch between global and rate remapping is self-organized; and (6) grid cell input to place cells helps stabilize their code under noisy and/or inconsistent sensory input. We conclude that the hippocampus-entorhinal circuit uses the mutual interaction of place and grid cells to encode the surrounding environment and propose a theory on how such interdependence underlies the formation and use of the cognitive map.
{SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT} The mammalian brain implements a positional system with two key pieces: place and grid cells. To gain insight into the dynamics of place and grid cell interaction, we built a computational model with the two cell types organized in a loop. The proposed model accounts for differences in how place and grid cells represent different environments and provides a new interpretation in which place and grid cells mutually interact to form a coupled code for space.},

Iyengar, yoga is an ancient Indian science which includes all aspects of one’s being, from health to self-realization. Yoga is self-management of life, which includes changes in diet, mental attitude and the practice of specific techniques such as yoga asanas (postures), breathing practices (pranayamas), meditation, to attain the highest level of consciousness. There is an increase in scientific research on yoga, but we do find very few reviews regarding yogic practices and diet counseling in health and disease. Keeping this in mind, review of relevant articles was done to evaluate the physiological effects of yogic practices and diet counseling. Review found that there were considerable health benefits, including improved sleep pattern, cognition, body mass index, reproductive health, respiration, blood pressure, joint disorders, diabetes and recovery from and treatment of addiction. It reduced stress, anxiety, depression, chronic pain, cardiovascular and cancer risk. Yoga also influenced overall well-being, quality of life, autonomic function and immunity. Therefore Yoga and Diet counseling is a novel emerging clinical discipline of mind-body medicine which is increasingly used worldwide under alternative medicine.},

These include transmembrane proteins (ion channels, transporters, G protein-coupled receptors, receptor-linked enzymes), soluble proteins (kinases, proteases, factors involved in epigenetic regulation), lipid membranes, and nucleic acids. In this review, we provide an overview of photopharmacology using synthetic switches that have been applied in vivo, i.e., in living cells and organisms. We discuss the scope and limitations of this approach to study biological function and the challenges it faces in translational medicine.

	abstract = {Neural interface technology has made enormous strides in recent years but stimulating electrodes remain incapable of reliably targeting speciﬁc cell types (e.g. excitatory or inhibitory neurons) within neural tissue. This obstacle has major scientiﬁc and clinical implications. For example, there is intense debate among physicians, neuroengineers and neuroscientists regarding the relevant cell types recruited during deep brain stimulation ({DBS}); moreover, many debilitating side effects of {DBS} likely result from lack of cell-type speciﬁcity. We describe here a novel optical neural interface technology that will allow neuroengineers to optically address speciﬁc cell types in vivo with millisecond temporal precision. Channelrhodopsin-2 ({ChR}2), an algal light-activated ion channel we developed for use in mammals, can give rise to safe, light-driven stimulation of {CNS} neurons on a timescale of milliseconds. Because {ChR}2 is genetically targetable, speciﬁc populations of neurons even sparsely embedded within intact circuitry can be stimulated with high temporal precision. Here we report the ﬁrst in vivo behavioral demonstration of a functional optical neural interface ({ONI}) in intact animals, involving integrated ﬁberoptic and optogenetic technology. We developed a solid-state laser diode system that can be pulsed with millisecond precision, outputs 20 {mW} of power at 473 nm, and is coupled to a lightweight, ﬂexible multimode optical ﬁber, ∼200 µm in diameter. To capitalize on the unique advantages of this system, we speciﬁcally targeted {ChR}2 to excitatory cells in vivo with the {CaMKIIα} promoter. Under these conditions, the intensity of light exiting the ﬁber (∼380 {mW} mm−2) was sufﬁcient to drive excitatory neurons in vivo and control motor cortex function with behavioral output in intact rodents. No exogenous chemical cofactor was needed at any point, a crucial ﬁnding for in vivo work in large mammals. Achieving modulation of behavior with optical control of neuronal subtypes may give rise to fundamental network-level insights complementary to what electrode methodologies have taught us, and the emerging optogenetic toolkit may ﬁnd application across a broad range of neuroscience, neuroengineering and clinical questions.},

By combining optical and genetic approaches, neural signaling can be bi-directionally controlled through expression of light-sensitive ion channels (opsins) in mammalian cells. The current protocol describes delivery of specific wavelengths of light to opsin-expressing cells in deep brain structures of awake, freely-moving rodents for neural circuit modulation. Theoretical principles of light transmission as an experimental consideration are discussed in the context of performing in vivo optogenetic stimulation.

We report a scalable method to monolithically integrate microscopic light emitting diodes (μ{LEDs}) and recording sites onto silicon neural probes for optogenetic applications in neuroscience. Each μ{LED} and recording site has dimensions similar to a pyramidal neuron soma, providing confined emission and electrophysiological recording of action potentials and local field activity. We fabricated and implanted the four-shank probes, each integrated with 12 μ{LEDs} and 32 recording sites, into the {CA}1 pyramidal layer of anesthetized and freely moving mice. Spikes were robustly induced by 60 {nW} light power, and fast population oscillations were induced at the microwatt range. To demonstrate the spatiotemporal precision of parallel stimulation and recording, we achieved independent control of distinct cells ∼50 μm apart and of differential somato-dendritic compartments of single neurons. The scalability and spatiotemporal resolution of this monolithic optogenetic tool provides versatility and precision for cellular-level circuit analysis in deep structures of intact, freely moving animals.},

	abstract = {In recent years optogenetics has rapidly become an essential technique in neuroscience. Its temporal and spatial specificity, combined with efficacy in manipulating neuronal activity, are especially useful in studying the behavior of awake behaving animals. Conventional optogenetics, however, requires the use of lasers and optic fibers, which can place considerable restrictions on behavior. Here we combined a wirelessly controlled interface and small implantable light-emitting diode ({LED}) that allows flexible and precise placement of light source to illuminate any brain area. We tested this wireless {LED} system in vivo, in transgenic mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 in striatonigral neurons expressing D1-like dopamine receptors. In all mice tested, we were able to elicit movements reliably. The frequency of twitches induced by high power stimulation is proportional to the frequency of stimulation. At lower power, contraversive turning was observed. Moreover, the implanted {LED} remains effective over 50 days after surgery, demonstrating the long-term stability of the light source. Our results show that the wireless {LED} system can be used to manipulate neural activity chronically in behaving mice without impeding natural movements.},

The brain consists of various types of neuron sets, which organize in three-dimensional complex networks and form neural circuits underlying different behaviors. The circuits act based on the patterns that encode the brain functions. Recognition of the neural patterns requires methods to manipulate the neurons. Electrical stimulation may be the most common method. However, it has significant drawbacks including failure to identify specific neurons in experiments. As an alternative, optical stimulation is a new method that acts in combination with genetic approaches. The novel, optogenetic technology makes it feasible to manipulate either the specific cell types or the neural circuits. This is associated with minimum tissue damages as well as side effects. In this study, a new technology has been introduced, and then its optical and genetical tools have been investigated.},

	abstract = {A functional model for the aspartate/glutamate carrier of the inner mitochondrial membrane was established based on a kinetic evaluation of this transporter. Antiport kinetics were measured in proteoliposomes that contained partially purified carrier protein of definite transmembrane orientation (Dierks, T. and Krämer, R. (1988) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 937, 122-126). Bireactant initial velocity analyses of the counterexchange reaction were carried out varying substrate concentrations both in the internal and the external compartment. The kinetic patterns obtained were inconsistent with a pong-pong mechanism; rather they demonstrated the formation of a ternary complex as a consequence of sequential binding of one internal and one external substrate molecule to the carrier. Studies on transport activity in the presence of aspartate and glutamate in the same compartment (formally treated as substrate inhibition) clearly indicated that during exchange only one form of the carrier at either membrane surface exposes its binding sites, for which the two different substrates compete. In the deenergized state ({pH} 6.5) both substrates were translocated at about the same rate. Aspartate/glutamate antiport became asymmetric if a membrane potential was imposed, due to the electrogenic nature of the heteroexchange resulting from proton cotransport together with glutamate. Investigation of the electrical properties of aspartate/aspartate homoexchange led to the conclusion that the translocating carrier-substrate intermediate exhibits a transmembrane symmetry with respect to the (negative) charge, which again only is conceivable assuming a ternary complex. Thus, an antiport model is outlined that shows the functional complex of the carrier with two substrate molecules bound, one at either side of the membrane. The conformational change associated with the transition of both substrate molecules across the membrane then occurs in a single step. Furthermore the model implicates a distinct proton binding site, which is derived from the different influence of H+ concentration observed on transport affinity and transport velocity, respectively, when glutamate is used as a substrate.},

The criterion for cell death was an increase in its volume to the level at which it is sequestrated from the circulation or is lysed. In hemolytic anemia associated with hexokinase or pyruvate kinase deficiency, activities of these enzymes measured in patient erythrocytes appeared to be close to the calculated critical values. By contrast, in hemolytic anemia associated with phosphofructokinase, glucosephosphate isomerase, triosephosphate isomerase, or phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency, activities of these enzymes measured in patient erythrocytes were significantly greater than the calculated critical values. In this case, if the deficient enzyme were stable, i.e. its activity in the cell were low, but constant in time, the deficiency observed would not account for the erythrocyte destruction observed and the development of hemolytic anemia. It was shown, however, that in phosphofructokinase, glucosephosphate isomerase, triosephosphate isomerase, or phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency, hemolytic anemia can arise because of the instability of these enzymes in time.},

(1996). Biochim. Biophys. Acta1279, 144–148). In this paper the mechanism by which the potassium cation specifically activates the L-glutamate–sodium cotransport process is investigated. Potassium has been found to act as an activator when it is present inside the membrane vesicles, while its presence outside is ineffective, and the effect is saturable. The kinetic parameters with respect to sodium and glutamate have been compared in the presence and in the absence of the activator. The results indicate that the ordered sodium–sodium glutamate mechanism is not altered by potassium, and that the activation is probably exerted on both the rate determining steps of the transport process. It is proposed that (1) a specific binding site for potassium is present on the inside hydrophilic part of the membrane carrier, (2) the binding of the effector accelerates the intramembrane rearrangement steps of both the disodium glutamate–carrier complex and the free carrier, (3) the affinity of the carrier is lowered with respect to sodium whereas it is increased for glutamate, and (4) K+ antiport is not performed by this carrier.},

	abstract = {The homologous exchange of external [14C]aspartate/internal aspartate catalyzed by the aspartate/glutamate carrier of rat heart mitochondria was investigated using aspartate-loaded, glutamate-depleted mitochondria. An inhibitor-stop technique was developed for kinetic studies by applying pyridoxal phosphate. Direct initial rate determinations from the linear phase of [14C]aspartate uptake were insufficiently accurate at high external and/or low internal substrate concentrations. Therefore, the full time-course of [14C]aspartate uptake until reaching isotope equilibrium was fitted by a single exponential function and was used to calculate reliable initial steady-state rates. This method was applied in bisubstrate analyses of the antiport reaction for different external and internal aspartate concentrations. The kinetic patterns obtained in double reciprocal plots showed straight lines converging on the abscissa. This result is consistent with a sequential antiport mechanism. It implies the existence of a catalytic ternary complex that is formed by the translocator and substrate molecules bound from both sides of the membrane. The Km values for aspartate were clearly different for the external and the internal sides of the membrane, 216±23 μM and 2.4±0.5 {mM}, respectively. These values indicated a definite transmembrane asymmetry of the carrier. The same asymmetry became evident when investigating the isolated protein from bovine heart mitochondria after reconstitution into liposomes. In this case the Km values for external and internal aspartate were determined to be 123±11 μM and 2.8±0.6 {mM}, respectively. This comparison demonstrates a right-side out orientation of the carrier after insertion into liposomal membranes. The sequential transport mechanism of the aspartate/glutamate carrier, elucidated both in proteoliposomes and in mitochondria, also seems to be a common characteristic of other mitochondrial antiport carriers.},

In particular, the citric acid cycle enzyme complex α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase ({KGDHC}) and respiratory chain complex I of the respiratory chain often show reduced activities in the dopaminergic neurons involved in Parkinson's disease, both giving rise to an impaired mitochondrial energy metabolism as demonstrated in a number of in vitro studies with cell lines as well as isolated mitochondria. To understand the metabolic regulation underlying these experimental findings we used a detailed kinetic model of mitochondrial energy metabolism. First, we investigated the effect of complex I inhibition on energy production and formation of reactive oxygen species ({ROS}). Next, we applied the model to a situation where both {KGDHC} and complex I exhibit reduced activities. These calculations reveal synergistic effects with respect to the energy metabolism but antagonistic effects with respect to {ROS} formation: the drop in the {ATP} production capacity is more pronounced than at inhibition of either enzyme complex alone. Interestingly, however, the reduction state of the {ROS}-generating sites of the impaired complex I becomes significantly lowered if additionally the activity of the {KGDHC} is reduced. We discuss the pathophysiological consequences of these intriguing findings.},

	abstract = {The capacity of the liver to convert the metabolic input received from the incoming portal and arterial blood into the metabolic output of the outgoing venous blood has three major determinants: The intra-hepatic blood flow, the transport of metabolites between blood vessels (sinusoids) and hepatocytes and the metabolic capacity of hepatocytes. These determinants are not constant across the organ: Even in the normal organ, but much more pronounced in the fibrotic and cirrhotic liver, regional variability of the capillary blood pressure, tissue architecture and the expression level of metabolic enzymes (zonation) have been reported. Understanding how this variability may affect the regional metabolic capacity of the liver is important for the interpretation of functional liver tests and planning of pharmacological and surgical interventions. Here we present a mathematical model of the sinusoidal tissue unit ({STU}) that is composed of a single sinusoid surrounded by the space of Disse and a monolayer of hepatocytes. The total metabolic output of the liver (arterio-venous glucose difference) is obtained by integration across the metabolic output of a representative number of {STUs}. Application of the model to the hepatic glucose metabolism provided the following insights: (i) At portal glucose concentrations between 6–8 {mM}, an intra-sinusoidal glucose cycle may occur which is constituted by glucose producing periportal hepatocytes and glucose consuming pericentral hepatocytes, (ii) Regional variability of hepatic blood flow is higher than the corresponding regional variability of the metabolic output, (iii) a spatially resolved metabolic functiogram of the liver is constructed. Variations of tissue parameters are equally important as variations of enzyme activities for the control of the arterio-venous glucose difference., Glucose homeostasis is one of the central liver functions. The liver extracts glucose from the blood when plasma glucose levels are high and produces glucose when plasma glucose levels are low. To fulfill this function the liver is organized in smallest functional units, the sinusoidal tissue units ({STUs}). These {STUs} consist of a single sinusoid surrounded by linear arranged hepatocytes. Liver zonation describes the spatial separation of metabolic pathways along the {STUs}. As blood flows through the sinusoid the plasma nutrient and hormone composition changes and in conjunction with the heterogeneous endowment of metabolic enzymes this leads to big differences in the metabolic performance of hepatocytes depending on their position within the sinusoid. This makes liver zonation and blood flow two central determinants for the functional output of the liver. In this work we present a tissue model of hepatic carbohydrate metabolism that combines liver zonation and microperfusion within the {STU}. We show that structural properties, enzymatic properties and regional bloodflow are equally important for the understanding of liver functionality. With our work we provide a true multi-scale model bridging the scale from the cellular to the tissue level.},

In order to quantify the relation between diminished {KGDHC} activity and the mitochondrial {ATP} generation, redox state, transmembrane potential, and generation of reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) by the respiratory chain ({RC}), we developed a detailed kinetic model. Model simulations revealed a threshold-like decline of the {ATP} production rate at about 60\% inhibition of {KGDHC} accompanied by a significant increase of the mitochondrial membrane potential. By contrast, progressive inhibition of the enzyme aconitase had only little impact on these mitochondrial parameters. As {KGDHC} is susceptible to {ROS}-dependent inactivation, we also investigated the reduction state of those sites of the {RC} proposed to be involved in {ROS} production. The reduction state of all sites except one decreased with increasing degree of {KGDHC} inhibition suggesting an {ROS}-reducing effect of {KGDHC} inhibition. Our model underpins the important role of reduced {KGDHC} activity in the energetic breakdown of neuronal cells during development of neurodegenerative diseases.},

We addressed this issue in area {CA}3 of hippocampal slice cultures under well-defined recording conditions using a 20\% O2 gas mixture. We combined recordings of local field potential and interstitial partial oxygen pressure ({pO}2) during three different activity states, namely fast network oscillations in the gamma-frequency band (30 to 100 Hz), spontaneous network activity and absence of spiking (action potentials). Oxygen consumption rates were determined by {pO}2 depth profiles with high spatial resolution and a mathematical model that considers convective transport, diffusion, and activity-dependent consumption of oxygen. We show that: (1) Relative oxygen consumption rate during cholinergic gamma oscillations was 2.2-fold and 5.3-fold higher compared with spontaneous activity and absence of spiking, respectively. (2) Gamma oscillations were associated with a similar large decrease in {pO}2 as observed previously with a 95\% O2 gas mixture. (3) Sufficient oxygenation during fast network oscillations in vivo is ensured by the calculated critical radius of 30 to 40 μm around a capillary. We conclude that the structural and biophysical features of brain tissue permit variations in local oxygen consumption by a factor of about five.},

	abstract = {The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex ({PDC}), required for complete glucose oxidation, is essential for brain development. Although {PDC} deficiency is associated with a severe clinical syndrome, little is known about its effects on either substrate oxidation or synthesis of key metabolites such as glutamate and glutamine. Computational simulations of brain metabolism indicated that a 25\% reduction in flux through {PDC} and a corresponding increase in flux from an alternative source of acetyl-{CoA} would substantially alter the 13C {NMR} spectrum obtained from brain tissue. Therefore, we evaluated metabolism of [1,6-13C2]glucose (oxidized by both neurons and glia) and [1,2-13C2]acetate (an energy source that bypasses {PDC}) in the cerebral cortex of adult mice mildly and selectively deficient in brain {PDC} activity, a viable model that recapitulates the human disorder. Intravenous infusions were performed in conscious mice and extracts of brain tissue were studied by 13C {NMR}. We hypothesized that mice deficient in {PDC} must increase the proportion of energy derived from acetate metabolism in the brain. Unexpectedly, the distribution of 13C in glutamate and glutamine, a measure of the relative flux of acetate and glucose into the citric acid cycle, was not altered. The 13C labeling pattern in glutamate differed significantly from glutamine, indicating preferential oxidation of [1,2-13C]acetate relative to [1,6-13C]glucose by a readily discernible metabolic domain of the brain of both normal and mutant mice, presumably glia. These findings illustrate that metabolic compartmentation is preserved in the {PDC}-deficient cerebral cortex, probably reflecting intact neuron–glia metabolic interactions, and that a reduction in brain {PDC} activity sufficient to induce cerebral dysgenesis during development does not appreciably disrupt energy metabolism in the mature brain.},

Previous experimental evidence suggested that complex {II} is not a significant contributor to the production of reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) in isolated mitochondria or intact cells unless mutated. However, we find that when complex I and complex {III} are inhibited and succinate concentration is low, complex {II} in rat skeletal muscle mitochondria can generate superoxide or H2O2 at high rates. These rates approach or exceed the maximum rates achieved by complex I or complex {III}. Complex {II} generates these {ROS} in both the forward reaction, with electrons supplied by succinate, and the reverse reaction, with electrons supplied from the reduced ubiquinone pool. {ROS} production in the reverse reaction is prevented by inhibition of complex {II} at either the ubiquinone-binding site (by atpenin A5) or the flavin (by malonate), whereas {ROS} production in the forward reaction is prevented by malonate but not by atpenin A5, showing that the {ROS} from complex {II} arises only from the flavin site (site {IIF}). We propose a mechanism for {ROS} production by complex {II} that relies upon the occupancy of the substrate oxidation site and the reduction state of the enzyme. We suggest that complex {II} may be an important contributor to physiological and pathological {ROS} production.},

The basic components included in the model are the reactions at complexes I, {III}, and {IV} of the electron transport system, {ATP} synthesis at F1F0 {ATPase}, substrate transporters including adenine nucleotide translocase and the phosphate–hydrogen co-transporter, and cation fluxes across the inner membrane including fluxes through the K+/H+ antiporter and passive H+ and K+ permeation. Estimation of 16 adjustable parameter values is based on fitting model simulations to nine independent data curves. The identified model is further validated by comparison to additional datasets measured from mitochondria isolated from rat heart and liver and observed at low oxygen concentration. To obtain reasonable fits to the available data, it is necessary to incorporate inorganic-phosphate-dependent activation of the dehydrogenase activity and the electron transport system. Specifically, it is shown that a model incorporating phosphate-dependent activation of complex {III} is able to reasonably reproduce the observed data. The resulting validated and verified model provides a foundation for building larger and more complex systems models and investigating complex physiological and pathophysiological interactions in cardiac energetics.},

This complexity arises because energy production both modulates and is modulated by the electrophysiological and contractile activity of the cardiac myocyte. Here, we present an integrated mathematical model of the cardiac cell that links excitation-contraction coupling with mitochondrial energy generation. The dynamics of the model are described by a system of 50 ordinary differential equations. The formulation explicitly incorporates cytoplasmic {ATP}-consuming processes associated with force generation and ion transport, as well as the creatine kinase reaction. Changes in the electrical and contractile activity of the myocyte are coupled to mitochondrial energetics through the {ATP}, Ca2+, and Na+ concentrations in the myoplasmic and mitochondrial matrix compartments. The pseudo steady-state relationship between force and oxygen consumption at various stimulus frequencies and external Ca2+ concentrations is reproduced in both model simulations and direct experiments in cardiac trabeculae under normoxic conditions, recapitulating the linearity between cardiac work and respiration in the heart. Importantly, the model can also reproduce the rapid time-dependent changes in mitochondrial {NADH} and Ca2+ in response to abrupt changes in workload. The steady-state and dynamic responses of the model were conferred by {ADP}-dependent stimulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and Ca2+-dependent regulation of Krebs cycle dehydrogenases, illustrating how the model can be used as a tool for investigating mechanisms underlying metabolic control in the heart.},

	abstract = {The scientific literature contains a tremendous amount of kinetic data describing the dynamic behaviour of biochemical reactions over time. These data are needed for computational modelling to create models of biochemical reaction networks and to obtain a better understanding of the processes in living cells. To extract the knowledge from the literature, biocurators are required to understand a paper and interpret the data. For modellers, as well as experimentalists, this process is very time consuming because the information is distributed across the publication and, in most cases, is insufficiently structured and often described without standard terminology. In recent years, biological databases for different data types have been developed. The advantages of these databases lie in their unified structure, searchability and the potential for augmented analysis by software, which supports the modelling process. We have developed the {SABIO}-{RK} database for biochemical reaction kinetics. In the present review, we describe the challenges for database developers and curators, beginning with an analysis of relevant publications up to the export of database information in a standardized format. The aim of the present review is to draw the experimentalist's attention to the problem (from a data integration point of view) of incompletely and imprecisely written publications. We describe how to lower the barrier to curators and improve this situation. At the same time, we are aware that curating experimental data takes time. There is a community concerned with making the task of publishing data with the proper structure and annotation to ontologies much easier. In this respect, we highlight some useful initiatives and tools.},

Under the conditions of the assay, the {pH} optimum occurs at {pH} 7.15. The molecular weight determined by Sephadex G-100 chromatography is 72 000 whereas ultracentrifugation in a sucrose gradient yields a molecular weight of 75 000. Furthermore using an antiserum prepared against purified rat brain glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, it was shown that rat brain glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is lighter than rabbit muscle glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Mr 78 000). The purified enzyme is extremely sensitive to p-mercuribenzoate, being demonstrably inhibited by 10 {nM}, although it is much less sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide and iodoacetate. The specific activity of the purified enzyme is 152 units/mg of protein, representing a 2800-fold increase in specific activity. Analytical acrylamide gel electrophoresis separates the purified enzyme into two bands of protein, each of which exhibits glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity.

	abstract = {{IntroductionThe} maldevelopment of the midline structures is connected with neurologic disorders. The cavum septum pellucidum ({CSP}) exists in the fetal period, then it is re-absorbed. The presence of unfused leaflets/fornices may be considered important in the genesis of neurodevelopmental abnormalities inclunding epilepsy. The limbic system includes a group of interconnected gray and white matter structures; in this circuit, the fornix is an important white matter connection with the septum pellucidum.{MethodsFive} children, 3–10 years of age, with epilepsy and an unfused septum pellucidum and fornices on {MRI}, were evaluated by diffusion tensor imaging-fiber tracking ({DTI}-{FT}) in order to explore the integrity of the axonal microenviroment of these structures.{ResultsThe} patients had generalized tonic–clonic seizures ({GTCS}). The electroencephalogram ({EEG}) showed focal–temporal abnormalities with secondary generalization. Magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) and {DTI}-{FT} demonstrated the {CSP}, and the presence of the fornix’s body split into two bundles with the fornices separated.{ConclusionThe} fornix appears more involved than {CSP} alone, as suggested by fornix atrophy observed in {MTLE}. Even if epilepsy is suggested to be a grey matter disorder, changes in the underlying brain connectivity have an important contribution in seizure generation and diffusion. In addition, the interconnections of medial septal area with hyppocampus, amygdala and entorhinal cortex, have led to the hypothesis of functional limbic epilepsy. In our patients, the role of {DTI} was not conclusive since the definition of the number of unmyelinated fibers responsible for epilepsy could not be demonstrated probably for a limited number of seizures and for a short period of drug administration.},

	abstract = {Temporal lobe epilepsy often leads to hippocampal sclerosis and persistent cognitive deficits, including difficulty with learning and memory. Hippocampal theta oscillations are critical in optimizing hippocampal function and facilitating plasticity. We hypothesized that pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus would disrupt oscillations and behavioral performance and that electrical neuromodulation to entrain theta would improve cognition specifically in injured rats. Rats received a pilocarpine (n=30) or saline injection (n=27) and unilateral bi-polar electrodes were implanted into the medial septum and hippocampus the following day. Hippocampal and septal theta were recorded in a Plexiglas box over the first week following implantation. Control and pilocarpine-treated rats were split into stimulation (continuous 7.7Hz, 80{μA}, 1ms pulse width) and non-stimulation groups for behavioral analysis. Continuous stimulation was initiated one-minute prior to and throughout an object exploration task (post-injury day seven) and again for each of six trials on the Barnes maze (post-injury days 12–14). There was a significant reduction in hippocampal theta power (p{\textless}0.05) and percentage of time oscillating in theta (p{\textless}0.05). In addition there was a significant decrease in object exploration in rats post-pilocarpine (p{\textless}0.05) and an impairment in spatial learning. Specifically, pilocarpine-treated rats were more likely to use random search strategies (p{\textless}0.001) and had an increase in latency to find the hidden platform (p{\textless}0.05) on the Barnes maze. Stimulation of the medial septum at 7.7Hz in pilocarpine-treated rats resulted in performance similar to shams in both the object recognition and Barnes maze tasks. Stimulation of sham rats resulted in impaired object exploration (p{\textless}0.05) with no difference in Barnes maze latency or strategy. In conclusion, pilocarpine-induced seizures diminished hippocampal oscillations and impaired performance in both an object exploration and a spatial memory task in pilocarpine-treated rats. Theta stimulation at 7.7Hz improved behavioral outcome on the Barnes maze task; this improvement in function was not related to a general cognitive enhancement, as shams did not benefit from stimulation. Therefore, stimulation of the medial septum represents an exciting target to improve behavioral outcome in patients with epilepsy.},

We evaluated the effects of experimental epilepsy on the areal density of cholinergic terminals (fiber varicosities) in the dentate gyrus. For this purpose, we used two distinct post-status epilepticus rat models, in which epilepsy was induced with injections of either kainic acid or pilocarpine. To visualize the cholinergic fibers, we used brain sections immunostained for the vesicular acetylcholine transporter. It was found that the density of cholinergic fiber varicosities was higher in epileptic rats versus control rats in the inner and outer zones of the dentate molecular layer, but it was reduced in the dentate hilus. We further evaluated the effects of kainate treatment on the total number, density, and soma volume of septal cholinergic cells, which were visualized in brain sections stained for either vesicular acetylcholine transporter or choline acetyltransferase ({ChAT}). Both the number of septal cells with cholinergic phenotype and their density were increased in epileptic rats when compared to control rats. The septal cells stained for vesicular acetylcholine transporter, but not for {ChAT}, have enlarged perikarya in epileptic rats. These results revealed previously unknown details of structural reorganization of the septohippocampal cholinergic system in experimental epilepsy, involving fiber sprouting into the dentate molecular layer and a parallel fiber retraction from the dentate hilus. We hypothesize that epilepsy-related neuroplasticity of septohippocampal cholinergic neurons is capable of increasing neuronal excitability of the dentate gyrus.},

Six rats received injections of tetanus toxin ({TeTX}) in the ventral hippocampus that resulted in chronic spontaneous seizures. The distribution of {SOV} before 486 seizures was analyzed for a total of 19 d of recording. Rapid eye movement sleep ({REM}) and exploratory wake, both of which express prominent hippocampal theta rhythm, preceded 47 and 34\%, for a total of 81\%, of all seizures. Nonrapid eye movement sleep ({NREM}) and nonexploratory wake, neither of which expresses prominent theta, preceded 6.8 and 13\% of seizures. We demonstrate that identification of {SOV} yields significant differentiation of seizure susceptibilities, with the instantaneous seizure rate during {REM} nearly 10 times higher than baseline and the rate for {NREM} less than half of baseline. Survival analysis indicated a shorter duration of preseizure {REM} bouts, with a maximum transition to seizure at ∼90 s after the onset of {REM}. This study provides the first analysis of a correlation between {SOV} and seizure onset in the {TeTX} model of temporal lobe epilepsy, as well as the first demonstration that hippocampal theta rhythms associated with natural behavioral states can serve a seizure-promoting role. Our findings are in contrast with previous studies suggesting that the correlations between {SOV} and seizures are primarily governed by circadian oscillations and the notion that hippocampal theta rhythms inhibit seizures. The documentation of significant {SOV}-dependent seizure susceptibilities indicates the potential utility of {SOV} and its time course in seizure prediction and control.},

	abstract = {Multiple studies have observed heterogeneous neuronal firing patterns as a local network transitions to spontaneous seizures. We demonstrated that separately examining interneurons and pyramidal cells during this transition in a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy elucidates some of this heterogeneity. Recently, it was demonstrated that classifying cells into specific theta-related subtypes further clarified the heterogeneity. Moreover, changes in neuronal synchrony with the local field potential were identified and determined to be specific to interneurons during the transition to seizures. To extend our understanding of the chronic changes in epileptic networks, we examined field potentials and single neuron activity in the {CA}3 hippocampus of pilocarpine-treated rats during interictal periods and compared these to neuronal activity in healthy controls and during preictal periods. Neurons were classified into theta-subtypes based on changes in firing patterns during theta periods. As previously reported, we find a high probability of theta oscillations before seizure onset and a selective increase in theta-on interneuron firing rate immediately preceding seizure onset. However, we also find overall slower theta rhythm and a general decrease in subtype-specific firing during interictal periods compared to that in control animals. The decrease in subtype specific interneuron activity is accompanied by increases in synchrony. Exceptionally, theta-on interneurons, that selectively increase their firing rate at seizure onset, maintain similar firing rates and synchrony as controls during interictal period. These data suggest that increased synchrony during interictal periods may compensate for low firing rates creating instability during theta that is prone to seizure initiation via a transition to hyper-synchronous activation of theta-on interneurons.},

Recent reports in human demonstrate a role of theta–gamma coupling in memory for spatial episodes and a lack of coupling in people experiencing temporal lobe epilepsy, but the mechanisms are unknown. Using multisite silicon probe recordings of epileptic rats engaged in episodic-like object recognition tasks, we sought to evaluate the role of theta–gamma coupling in the absence of epileptiform activities. Our data reveal a specific association between theta–gamma (30–60 Hz) coupling at the proximal stratum radiatum of {CA}1 and spatial memory deficits. We targeted the microcircuit mechanisms with a novel approach to identify putative interneuronal types in tetrode recordings (parvalbumin basket cells in particular) and validated classification criteria in the epileptic context with neurochemical identification of intracellularly recorded cells. In epileptic rats, putative parvalbumin basket cells fired poorly modulated at the falling theta phase, consistent with weaker inputs from Schaffer collaterals and attenuated gamma oscillations, as evaluated by theta-phase decomposition of current–source density signals. We propose that theta–gamma interneuronal rhythmopathies of the temporal lobe are intimately related to episodic memory dysfunction in this condition.},

	abstract = {Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity ({STDP}) is characterized by a wide range of temporal kernels. However, much of the theoretical work has focused on a specific kernel – the ‘‘temporally asymmetric Hebbian’’ learning rules. Previous studies linked excitatory {STDP} to positive feedback that can account for the emergence of response selectivity. Inhibitory plasticity was associated with negative feedback that can balance the excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Here we study the possible computational role of the temporal structure of the {STDP}. We represent the {STDP} as a superposition of two processes: potentiation and depression. This allows us to model a wide range of experimentally observed {STDP} kernels, from Hebbian to anti-Hebbian, by varying a single parameter. We investigate {STDP} dynamics of a single excitatory or inhibitory synapse in purely feed-forward architecture. We derive a mean-field-Fokker-Planck dynamics for the synaptic weight and analyze the effect of {STDP} structure on the fixed points of the mean field dynamics. We find a phase transition along the Hebbian to anti-Hebbian parameter from a phase that is characterized by a unimodal distribution of the synaptic weight, in which the {STDP} dynamics is governed by negative feedback, to a phase with positive feedback characterized by a bimodal distribution. The critical point of this transition depends on general properties of the {STDP} dynamics and not on the fine details. Namely, the dynamics is affected by the pre-post correlations only via a single number that quantifies its overlap with the {STDP} kernel. We find that by manipulating the {STDP} temporal kernel, negative feedback can be induced in excitatory synapses and positive feedback in inhibitory. Moreover, there is an exact symmetry between inhibitory and excitatory plasticity, i.e., for every {STDP} rule of inhibitory synapse there exists an {STDP} rule for excitatory synapse, such that their dynamics is identical.},

	abstract = {It is believed that both Hebbian and homeostatic mechanisms are essential in neural learning. While Hebbian plasticity selectively modifies synaptic connectivity according to activity experienced, homeostatic plasticity constrains this change so that neural activity is always within reasonable physiological limits. Recent experiments reveal spike timing-dependent plasticity ({STDP}) as a new type of Hebbian learning with high time precision and heterosynaptic plasticity ({HSP}) as a new homeostatic mechanism acting directly on synapses. Here, we study the effect of {STDP} and {HSP} on randomly connected neural networks. Despite the reported successes of {STDP} to account for neural activities at the single-cell level, we find that, surprisingly, at the network level, networks trained using {STDP} alone cannot seem to generate realistic neural activities. For instance, {STDP} would stipulate that past sensory experience be maintained forever if it is no longer activated. To overcome this difficulty, motivated by the fact that {HSP} can induce strong competition between sensory experiences, we propose a biophysically plausible learning rule by combining {STDP} and {HSP}. Based on the Fokker-Planck theory and extensive numerical computations, we demonstrate that {HSP} and {STDP} operated on different time scales can complement each other, resulting in more realistic network activities. Our finding may provide fresh insight into the learning mechanism of the brain.},

	abstract = {Computational models offer a unique tool for understanding the network-dynamical mechanisms which mediate between physiological and biophysical properties, and behavioral function. A traditional challenge in computational neuroscience is, however, that simple neuronal models which can be studied analytically fail to reproduce the diversity of electrophysiological behaviors seen in real neurons, while detailed neuronal models which do reproduce such diversity are intractable analytically and computationally expensive. A number of intermediate models have been proposed whose aim is to capture the diversity of firing behaviors and spike times of real neurons while entailing a mathematical description as simple as possible. One such model is the exponential integrate-and-fire neuron with spike rate adaptation ({aEIF}) which consists of two differential equations for the membrane potential (V) and an adaptation current (w). Despite its simplicity, it can reproduce a wide variety of physiologically observed spiking patterns, can be fit to physiological recordings quantitatively, and, once done so, is able to predict spike times on traces not used for model fitting. Here we compute the steady-state firing rate of {aEIF} in the presence of Gaussian synaptic noise, using two approaches. The first approach is based on the 2-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation that describes the (V,w)-probability distribution, which is solved using an expansion in the ratio between the time constants of the two variables. The second is based on the firing rate of the {EIF} model, which is averaged over the distribution of the \$w\$ variable. These analytically derived closed-form expressions were tested on simulations from a large variety of model cells quantitatively fitted to in vitro electrophysiological recordings from pyramidal cells and interneurons. Theoretical predictions closely agreed with the firing rate of the simulated cells fed with in-vivo-like synaptic noise.},

	abstract = {The origins and functional significance of theta phase precession in the hippocampus remain obscure, in part, because of the difficulty of reproducing hippocampal place cell firing in experimental settings where the biophysical underpinnings can be examined in detail. The present study concerns a neurobiologically based computational model of the emergence of theta phase precession in which the responses of a single model {CA}3 pyramidal cell are examined in the context of stimulation by realistic afferent spike trains including those of place cells in entorhinal cortex, dentate gyrus, and other {CA}3 pyramidal cells. Spike-timing dependent plasticity in the model {CA}3 pyramidal cell leads to a spatially correlated associational synaptic drive that subsequently creates a spatially asymmetric expansion of the model cell’s place field. Following an initial training period, theta phase precession can be seen in the firing patterns of the model {CA}3 pyramidal cell. Through selective manipulations of the model it is possible to decompose theta phase precession in {CA}3 into the separate contributing factors of inheritance from upstream afferents in the dentate gyrus and entorhinal cortex, the interaction of synaptically controlled increasing afferent drive with phasic inhibition, and the theta phase difference between dentate gyrus granule cell and {CA}3 pyramidal cell activity. In the context of a single {CA}3 pyramidal cell, the model shows that each of these factors plays a role in theta phase precession within {CA}3 and suggests that no one single factor offers a complete explanation of the phenomenon. The model also shows parallels between theta phase encoding and pattern completion within the {CA}3 autoassociative network.},

	abstract = {The M-current ({IM}), comprised of Kv7 channels, is a voltage-activated K+ conductance that plays a key role in the control of cell excitability. In hippocampal principal cells, {IM} controls action potential ({AP}) accommodation and contributes to the medium-duration afterhyperpolarization, but the role of {IM} in control of interneuron excitability remains unclear. Here, we investigated {IM} in hippocampal stratum oriens ({SO}) interneurons, both from wild-type and transgenic mice in which green fluorescent protein ({GFP}) was expressed in somatostatin-containing interneurons. Somatodendritic expression of Kv7.2 or Kv7.3 subunits was colocalized in a subset of {GFP}+ {SO} interneurons, corresponding to oriens-lacunosum moleculare (O-{LM}) cells. Under voltage clamp ({VC}) conditions at −30 {mV}, the Kv7 channel antagonists linopirdine/{XE}-991 abolished the {IM} amplitude present during relaxation from −30 to −50 {mV} and reduced the holding current (Ihold). In addition, 0.5 mm tetraethylammonium reduced {IM}, suggesting that {IM} was composed of Kv7.2-containing channels. In contrast, the Kv7 channel opener retigabine increased {IM} amplitude and Ihold. When strongly depolarized in {VC}, the linopirdine-sensitive outward current activated rapidly and comprised up to 20\% of the total current. In current-clamp recordings from {GFP}+ {SO} cells, linopirdine induced depolarization and increased {AP} frequency, whereas retigabine induced hyperpolarization and arrested firing. In multicompartment O-{LM} interneuron models that incorporated {IM}, somatodendritic placement of Kv7 channels best reproduced experimentally measured {IM}. The models suggest that Kv3- and Kv7-mediated channels both rapidly activate during single {APs}; however, Kv3 channels control rapid repolarization of the {AP}, whereas Kv7 channels primarily control the interspike interval.},

This work aligns and satisfies the widespread dipole assumption that is motivated by the \&quot;open-field\&quot; configuration of the dendritic field potential around cortical pyramidal cells. Our reduced three-compartment scheme allows to derive networks of leaky integrate-and-fire models, which facilitates comparison with existing neural network and observation models.

Several evidences have demonstrated that astrocytes are able to control the synaptic plasticity, with astrocytes being active partners in synaptic physiology and E/I balance. Here, we revise molecular evidences showing the epileptic stage as an abnormal form of long-term brain plasticity and propose the possible participation of astrocytes to the abnormal increase of glutamatergic and decrease of {GABAergic} neurotransmission in epileptic networks.},

Here, we attempt to apply concepts of homeostasis in general, and more specifically synaptic homeostatic plasticity, to the study of epilepsy. We hypothesize that homeostatic mechanisms are actively engaged in the epileptic brain. These processes attempt to re-establish normal neuronal and network activity, but are opposed by the concurrent mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis. In forms of intractable epilepsy, seizures are so frequent and intense that homeostatic mechanisms are unable to restore normal levels of neuronal activity. In such cases, we contend that homeostatic plasticity mechanisms nevertheless remain active. However, their continuing attempts to reset neuronal activity become maladaptive and results in dyshomeostasis with neurobehavioral consequences. Using the developing hippocampus as a model system, we briefly review experimental results and present a series of arguments to propose that the cognitive neurobehavioral comorbidities of childhood epilepsy result, at least in part, from unchecked homeostatic mechanisms.},

Understanding the mechanisms by which neonatal seizures adversely disturb the immature brain is important in developing therapeutic strategies.

	abstract = {Background
Memory impairment is commonly associated with epilepsy, and the use of antiepileptic drugs ({AEDs}) causes additional neuropsychologic deficits that are of particular concern in learning-age children and elderly patients. The aim of this study was to investigate hippocampal synaptic plasticity and morphology as well as hippocampal-dependent memory in physiologic conditions and in a genetic model of epilepsy following chronic treatment with the widely used {AED} valproic acid ({VPA}).
Methods
Mice lacking the presynaptic scaffolding protein Bassoon were used as a model of epilepsy. Electrophysiologic recordings were used to analyze basal glutamatergic synaptic transmission, paired-pulse facilitation, and activity-dependent long-term potentiation ({LTP}) in the {CA}1 area. Dendritic morphology and spine density were analyzed, and glutamate-related signaling was investigated by Western blot analysis. Social transmission of food preference test was used to investigate nonspatial hippocampal memory.
Results
{VPA} treatment significantly reduced seizures frequency and mortality in epileptic mice. Long-term potentiation was absent at {CA}1 synapses of untreated epileptic mutant mice that also showed significant dendritic abnormalities. Treatment with {VPA} rescued physiologic {LTP} but did not reverse morphological abnormalities and deficits in nonspatial hippocampal memory observed in mutant epileptic mice. Moreover, {VPA} was found to induce per se dendritic abnormalities and memory dysfunction in normal animals.
Conclusions
The impairment of hippocampal synaptic plasticity in epileptic mice, rescued by {VPA} treatment, might represent the mechanism underlying epilepsy-induced memory deficits. Moreover, the demonstration that {VPA} induces morphologic alterations and impairment in specific hippocampal-dependent memory task might explain the detrimental effects of antiepileptic treatment on cognition in human subjects.},

In brain networks, both of these properties are critically affected by the type and levels of neuromodulators present. The expression of many of the most powerful neuromodulators, including acetylcholine ({ACh}), varies tonically and phasically with behavioural state, leading to dynamic, heterogeneous changes in intrinsic neural properties and synaptic connectivity properties. Namely, {ACh} significantly alters neural firing properties as measured by the phase response curve in a manner that has been shown to alter the propensity for network synchronization. The aim of this simulation study was to build an understanding of how heterogeneity in cholinergic modulation of neural firing properties and heterogeneity in synaptic connectivity affect the initiation and maintenance of synchronous network bursting in excitatory networks. We show that cells that display different levels of {ACh} modulation have differential roles in generating network activity: weakly modulated cells are necessary for burst initiation and provide synchronizing drive to the rest of the network, whereas strongly modulated cells provide the overall activity level necessary to sustain burst firing. By applying several quantitative measures of network activity, we further show that the existence of network bursting and its characteristics, such as burst duration and intraburst synchrony, are dependent on the fraction of cell types providing the synaptic connections in the network. These results suggest mechanisms underlying {ACh} modulation of brain oscillations and the modulation of seizure activity during sleep states.},

In recent years, correlated noise-induced synchronization has received support from many theoretical and experimental studies. However, many of these prior studies have assumed that neurons have identical biophysical properties and that their inputs are well modeled by white noise. In this context, we use colored noise to induce synchronization between oscillators with heterogeneity in both phase-response curves and frequencies. {\textbackslash}{INS}\{In the low noise limit,\} we derive novel analytical theory showing that the time constant of colored noise influences correlated noise-induced synchronization and that oscillator heterogeneity can limit synchronization.

This new staining method opened the way for structural investigations of the nervous tissue, that culminated in the extraordinary neuroanatomical work of Ramón y Cajal and the formulation of the neuron doctrine. Later developments in neurochemical techniques have revealed an astonishing diversity of neural circuits at the molecular level. This essay reflects on the physiological importance of the molecular heterogeneity of synaptic connections. Dendrodendritic circuits of the olfactory bulb will serve as a case for illustrating the relation between molecular composition and functional properties. Specifically, I will consider how the differential expression of {GABAA} receptor subtypes shapes dendrodendritic inhibition and influences olfactory bulb network activities. A concept emerging from recent investigations is that the molecular diversity of {GABAergic} systems supports neural circuit operations under an extensive range of behavior-dependent network states. Considering the great molecular diversity of synaptic connections, it is useful to reflect on the importance of high-resolution immunohistochemical analyses as a tool for investigating the structural and functional architecture of neural circuits.},

Even neurons of the same type come with huge variances in their properties and these properties also vary over time. Synapses, the connections between neurons, are highly unreliable in forwarding signals. In this paper we argue that both these fact add variance to neuronal processes, and that this variance is not a handicap of neural systems, but that instead predictable and reliable functional behavior of neural systems depends crucially on this variability. In particular, we show that higher variance allows a recurrently connected neural population to react more sensitively to incoming signals, and processes them faster and more energy efficient. This, for example, challenges the general assumption that the intrinsic variability of neurons in the brain is a defect that has to be overcome by synaptic plasticity in the process of learning.},

Classical theories of associative memory model {CA}3 as a homogeneous attractor network because of its strong recurrent circuitry. However, anatomical gradients suggest a functional diversity along the {CA}3 transverse axis. We examined the neural population coherence along this axis, when the local and global spatial reference frames were put in conflict with each other. Proximal {CA}3 (near the dentate gyrus), where the recurrent collaterals are the weakest, showed degraded representations, similar to the pattern separation shown by the dentate gyrus. Distal {CA}3 (near {CA}2), where the recurrent collaterals are the strongest, maintained coherent representations in the conflict situation, resembling the classic attractor network system. {CA}2 also maintained coherent representations. This dissociation between proximal and distal {CA}3 provides strong evidence that the recurrent collateral system underlies the associative network functions of {CA}3, with a separate role of proximal {CA}3 in pattern separation.},

Instead, it is becoming clear that seizures involve a complex interplay of different neurons and circuits.

	abstract = {A neural correlate of parametric working memory is a stimulus-specific rise in neuron firing rate that persists long after the stimulus is removed. Network models with local excitation and broad inhibition support persistent neural activity, linking network architecture and parametric working memory. Cortical neurons receive noisy input fluctuations that cause persistent activity to diffusively wander about the network, degrading memory over time. We explore how cortical architecture that supports parametric working memory affects the diffusion of persistent neural activity. Studying both a spiking network and a simplified potential well model, we show that spatially heterogeneous excitatory coupling stabilizes a discrete number of persistent states, reducing the diffusion of persistent activity over the network. However, heterogeneous coupling also coarse-grains the stimulus representation space, limiting the storage capacity of parametric working memory. The storage errors due to coarse-graining and diffusion trade off so that information transfer between the initial and recalled stimulus is optimized at a fixed network heterogeneity. For sufficiently long delay times, the optimal number of attractors is less than the number of possible stimuli, suggesting that memory networks can under-represent stimulus space to optimize performance. Our results clearly demonstrate the combined effects of network architecture and stochastic fluctuations on parametric memory storage.},

	abstract = {Heterogeneity of neural attributes has recently gained a lot of attention and is increasing recognized as a crucial feature in neural processing. Despite its importance, this physiological feature has traditionally been neglected in theoretical studies of cortical neural networks. Thus, there is still a lot unknown about the consequences of cellular and circuit heterogeneity in spiking neural networks. In particular, combining network or synaptic heterogeneity and intrinsic heterogeneity has yet to be considered systematically despite the fact that both are known to exist and likely have significant roles in neural network dynamics. In a canonical recurrent spiking neural network model, we study how these two forms of heterogeneity lead to different distributions of excitatory firing rates. To analytically characterize how these types of heterogeneities affect the network, we employ a dimension reduction method that relies on a combination of Monte Carlo simulations and probability density function equations. We find that the relationship between intrinsic and network heterogeneity has a strong effect on the overall level of heterogeneity of the firing rates. Specifically, this relationship can lead to amplification or attenuation of firing rate heterogeneity, and these effects depend on whether the recurrent network is firing asynchronously or rhythmically firing. These observations are captured with the aforementioned reduction method, and furthermore simpler analytic descriptions based on this dimension reduction method are developed. The final analytic descriptions provide compact and descriptive formulas for how the relationship between intrinsic and network heterogeneity determines the firing rate heterogeneity dynamics in various settings.},

We combined progenitor subtype–specific sorting with transcriptome-wide {RNA} sequencing to identify genes enriched in human {ORG}, which included targets of the transcription factor neurogenin and previously uncharacterized, evolutionarily dynamic long noncoding {RNAs}. Activating the neurogenin pathway in ferret progenitors promoted delamination and outward migration. Finally, single-cell transcriptional profiling in human, ferret and mouse revealed more cells coexpressing proneural neurogenin targets in human than in other species, suggesting greater neuronal lineage commitment and differentiation of self-renewing progenitors.

Several proposed mechanisms of synchronization have gained support through combined theoretical and experimental investigation, including mechanisms based on coupling and correlated input. Here, we ask how correlation-induced synchrony is affected by physiological heterogeneity across neurons. To address this question, we examined cell-to-cell differences in phase-response curves ({PRCs}), which characterize the response of periodically firing neurons to weak perturbations. Using acute slice electrophysiology, we measured {PRCs} across a single class of principal neurons capable of sensory-evoked oscillations in vivo: the olfactory bulb mitral cells ({MCs}). Periodically firing {MCs} displayed a broad range of {PRCs}, each of which was well fit by a simple three-parameter model. {MCs} also displayed differences in firing rate-current relationships and in preferred firing rate ranges. Both the observed {PRC} heterogeneity and moderate firing rate differences (∼10 Hz) separately reduced the maximum correlation-induced synchrony between {MCs} by up to 25–30\%. Simulations further demonstrated that these components of heterogeneity alone were sufficient to account for the difference in synchronization among heterogeneous vs. homogeneous populations in vitro. Within this simulation framework, independent modulation of specific {PRC} features additionally revealed which aspects of {PRC} heterogeneity most strongly impact correlation-induced synchronization. Finally, we demonstrated good agreement of novel mathematical theory with our experimental and simulation results, providing a theoretical basis for the influence of heterogeneity on correlation-induced neural synchronization.},

It is still not known, however, how neural heterogeneity can affect cortical computations, or impact the dynamics of typical cortical circuits constituted of sparse excitatory and inhibitory networks. In this work, we analytically and numerically study the dynamics of a typical cortical circuit with a certain level of neural heterogeneity. Our circuit includes realistic features found in real cortical populations, such as network sparseness, excitatory and inhibitory subpopulations of neurons, and different cell-to-cell heterogeneities for each type of population in the system. We find highly differentiated roles for heterogeneity, depending on the subpopulation in which it is found. In particular, while heterogeneity among excitatory neurons nonlinearly increases the mean firing rate and linearizes the f-I curves, heterogeneity among inhibitory neurons may decrease the network activity level and induces divisive gain effects in the f-I curves of the excitatory cells, providing an effective gain control mechanism to influence information flow. In addition, we compute the conditions for stability of the network activity, finding that the synchronization onset is robust to inhibitory heterogeneity, but it shifts to lower input levels for higher excitatory heterogeneity. Finally, we provide an extension of recently reported heterogeneity-induced mechanisms for signal detection under rate coding, and we explore the validity of our findings when multiple sources of heterogeneity are present. These results allow for a detailed characterization of the role of neural heterogeneity in asynchronous cortical networks.},

Recent studies have shown that neural heterogeneity in higher brain areas enhances the efficiency of encoding by reducing redundancy across the population. Here, we study how neural heterogeneity in the early stages of sensory processing influences the efficiency of population codes. Through the analysis of in vivo recordings, we contrast the encoding of two types of communication signals of electric fishes in the most peripheral sensory area of the {CNS}, the electrosensory lateral line lobe ({ELL}). We show that communication signals used during courtship (big chirps) and during aggressive encounters (small chirps) are encoded by different populations of {ELL} pyramidal cells, namely I-cells and E-cells, respectively. Most importantly, we show that the encoding strategy differs for the two signals and we argue that these differences allow these cell types to encode specifically information-rich features of the signals. Small chirps are detected, and their timing is accurately signaled through stereotyped spike bursts, whereas the shape of big chirps is accurately represented by variable increases in firing rate. Furthermore, we show that the heterogeneity across I-cells enhances the efficiency of the population code and thus permits the accurate discrimination of different quality courtship signals. Our study shows the importance of neural heterogeneity early in a sensory system and that it initiates the sparsification of sensory representation thereby contributing to the efficiency of the neural code.},

The {PaS} receives strong cholinergic innervation from the basal forebrain that is likely to modulate neuronal excitability and contribute to theta-frequency network activity. The present study used whole cell current- and voltage-clamp recordings to determine the effects of cholinergic receptor activation on layer {II} {PaS} neurons. Bath application of carbachol ({CCh}; 10–50 µM) resulted in a dose-dependent depolarization of morphologically-identified layer {II} stellate and pyramidal cells that was not prevented by blockade of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. Bath application of the M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine (1 µM), but not the M2-preferring antagonist methoctramine (1 µM), blocked the depolarization, suggesting that it is dependent on M1 receptors. Voltage-clamp experiments using ramped voltage commands showed that {CCh} resulted in the gradual development of an inward current that was partially blocked by concurrent application of the selective Kv7.2/3 channel antagonist {XE}-991, which inhibits the muscarine-dependent K+ current {IM}. The remaining inward current also reversed near {EK} and was inhibited by the K+ channel blocker Ba2+, suggesting that M1 receptor activation attenuates both {IM} as well as an additional K+ current. The additional K+ current showed rectification at depolarized voltages, similar to K+ conductances mediated by Kir 2.3 channels. The cholinergic depolarization of layer {II} {PaS} neurons therefore appears to occur through M1-mediated effects on {IM} as well as an additional K+ conductance.},

	abstract = {Hippocampal {CA}1 pyramidal neurons are normally quiescent but can fire spontaneously when stimulated by muscarinic agonists. In brain slice recordings from mouse {CA}1 pyramidal neurons, we examined the ionic basis of this activity using interleaved current-clamp and voltage-clamp experiments. Both in control and after muscarinic stimulation, the steady-state current–voltage curve was dominated by inward {TTX}-sensitive persistent sodium current ({INaP}) that activated near −75 {mV} and increased steeply with depolarization. In control, total membrane current was net outward (hyperpolarizing) near −70 {mV} so that cells had a stable resting potential. Muscarinic stimulation activated a small nonselective cation current so that total membrane current near −70 {mV} shifted to become barely net inward (depolarizing). The small depolarization triggers regenerative activation of {INaP}, which then depolarizes the cell from −70 {mV} to spike threshold. We quantified the relative contributions of {INaP}, hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih), and calcium current to pacemaking by using the cell's own firing as a voltage command along with specific blockers. {TTX}-sensitive sodium current was substantial throughout the entire interspike interval, increasing as the membrane potential approached threshold, while both Ih and calcium current were minimal. Thus, spontaneous activity is driven primarily by activation of {INaP} in a positive feedback loop starting near −70 {mV} and providing increasing inward current to threshold. These results show that the pacemaking “engine” from {INaP} is an inherent property of {CA}1 pyramidal neurons that can be engaged or disengaged by small shifts in net membrane current near −70 {mV}, as by muscarinic stimulation.},

	abstract = {The rodent hippocampus and entorhinal cortex contain spatially modulated cells that serve as the basis for spatial coding. Both medial entorhinal grid cells and hippocampal place cells have been shown to encode spatial information across multiple spatial scales that increase along the dorsoventral axis of these structures. Place cells near the dorsal pole possess small, stable, and spatially selective firing fields, while ventral cells have larger, less stable, and less spatially selective firing fields. One possible explanation for these dorsoventral changes in place field properties is that they arise as a result of similar dorsoventral differences in the properties of the grid cell inputs to place cells. Here, we test the alternative hypothesis that dorsoventral place field differences are due to higher amounts of nonspatial inputs to ventral hippocampal cells. We use a computational model of the entorhinal-hippocampal network to assess the relative contributions of grid scale and nonspatial inputs in determining place field size and stability. In addition, we assess the consequences of grid node firing rate heterogeneity on place field stability. Our results suggest that dorsoventral differences in place cell properties can be better explained by changes in the amount of nonspatial inputs, rather than by changes in the scale of grid cell inputs, and that grid node heterogeneity may have important functional consequences. The observed gradient in field size may reflect a shift from processing primarily spatial information in the dorsal hippocampus to processing more nonspatial, contextual, and emotional information near the ventral hippocampus. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {The subiculum is in a pivotal position governing the output of the hippocampal formation. Despite this, it is a rather under-explored and sometimes ignored structure. Here, we discuss recent data indicating that the subiculum participates in a wide range of neurocognitive functions and processes. Some of the functions of subiculum are relatively well-known—these include providing a relatively coarse representation of space and participating in, and supporting certain aspects of, memory (particularly in the dynamic bridging of temporal intervals). The subiculum also participates in a wide variety of other neurocognitive functions too, however. Much less well-known are roles for the subiculum, and particularly the ventral subiculum, in the response to fear, stress and anxiety, and in the generation of motivated behaviour (particularly the behaviour that underlies drug addiction and the response to reward). There is an emerging suggestion that the subiculum participates in the temporal control of behaviour. It is notable that these latter ﬁndings have emerged from a consideration of instrumental behaviour using operant techniques; it may well be the case that the use of the watermaze or similar spatial tasks to assess subicular function (on the presumption that its functions are very similar to the hippocampus proper) has obscured rather than revealed neurocognitive functions of subiculum. The anatomy of subiculum suggests it participates in a rather subtle fashion in a very broad range of functions, rather than in a relatively more isolated fashion in a narrower range of functions, as might be the case for “earlier” components of hippocampal circuitry, such as the {CA}1 and {CA}3 subﬁelds. Overall, there appears to a strong dorso-ventral segregation of function within subiculum, with the dorsal subiculum relatively more concerned with space and memory, and the ventral hippocampus concerned with stress, anxiety and reward. Finally, it may be the case that the whole subiculum participates in the temporal control of reinforced behaviour, although further experimentation is required to clarify this hypothesis.},

First, sites of granule cell generation, their modes and routes of migration are described. This is followed by an analysis of the molecular determinants governing the formation of a tightly packed granule cell layer that is normal in rodents and primates. Reelin, a protein of the extracellular matrix, plays an important role for the proper migration and lamination of the granule cells during development and for the maintenance of a laminated dentate gyrus in adulthood. Granule cell positioning is crucial for the laminated termination of commissural/associational ﬁbers to the dentate gyrus, suggesting that the granule cells carry positional signals for these ﬁbers. In contrast, not signals of the target cells but molecules of the extracellular matrix, such as hyaluronan, underlie the layer-speciﬁc termination of ﬁbers from the entorhinal cortex. The molecular determinants controlling axonal pathﬁnding and target recognition of the profusely terminating cholinergic and {GABAergic} subcortical afferents still need to be elucidated.},

Considering the topographical distribution of sensory cortical inputs, the hypothesis is that the major parallel circuits carry functionally different information. These functionally different parallel routes reach different portions of the hippocampal network along the longitudinal axis of all fields as well as along the perpendicularly oriented transverse axis of {CA}1 and the subiculum. In the remaining fields of the hippocampal formation, that is, the dentate gyrus and {CA}2/{CA}3, separation along the transverse axis is not present. By contrast, here the functionally different pathways converge onto the same neuronal population. The entorhinal cortex holds a pivotal position among the cortices that make up the parahippocampal region. By way of the networks of the superficial and deep layers, it mediates, respectively, the input and output streams of the hippocampal formation. Moreover, the intrinsic entorhinal network, particularly the interconnections between the deep and superficial layers, may mediate the comparison of hippocampal input and output signals. As such, the entorhinal cortex may form part of a novelty detection network. In addition, the organization of the entorhinal-hippocampal network may facilitate the holding of information. Finally, the terminal organization of the presubicular input to the medial entorhinal cortex indicates that the interactions between the deep and superficial entorhinal layers may be influenced by this input.},

	abstract = {The limbic system of the brain regulates a number of behaviors that are essential for the survival of all vertebrate species including humans. The limbic system predominantly controls appropriate responses to stimuli with social, emotional or motivational salience, which includes innate behaviors such as mating, aggression and defense. Activation of circuits regulating these innate behaviors begins in the periphery with sensory stimulation (primarily via the olfactory system in rodents), and is then processed in the brain by a set of delineated structures that primarily includes the amygdala and hypothalamus. While the basic neuroanatomy of these connections is well established, much remains unknown about how information is processed within innate circuits and how genetic hierarchies regulate development and function of these circuits. Utilizing innovative technologies including channel rhodopsin-based circuit manipulation and genetic manipulation in rodents, recent studies have begun to answer these central questions. In this article we review the current understanding of how limbic circuits regulate sexually dimorphism and how these circuits are established and shaped during pre- and post-natal development. We also discuss how understanding developmental processes of innate circuit formation may inform behavioral alterations observed in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, which are characterized by limbic system dysfunction.},

The subiculum has a range of electrophysiological and functional properties which are quite distinct from its input areas; given the widespread set of cortical and subcortical areas with which it interacts, it is able to influence activity in quite disparate brain regions. The rules governing plasticity of synaptic transmission in the hippocampal–subicular axis are poorly understood; this axis appears to share some properties in common with the hippocampus proper, but behaves quite differently in other respects. Equally, its functional properties are not well understood; it plays an important but ill-defined role in spatial navigation, mnemonic processing and control of the response to stress. Here, I review investigations of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal–subicular pathway, recordings of subicular neurons in the freely moving behaving animal, the effects of behavioural and other stressors on subicular synaptic plasticity, and anatomical data on the dorso-ventral organization of the subiculum in relation to the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal ({HPA}) axis. I argue that there is a dorso-ventral segregation of function within the subiculum: the dorsal component appears principally concerned with the processing of information about space, movement and memory, whereas the ventral component appears to play a major regulatory role in the inhibition of the {HPA} axis.},

In the literature, the {ProS} (in primate) and {PoS} (in rodent) are inconstantly identified, making data comparison difficult across species. This review is an attempt to discuss equivalencies and extent of the five subicular components in human, monkey, and rodent based on available information on their cytoarchitecture, chemoarchitecture, molecular signature, and neural connectivity. All five subicular cortices exist in human, monkey, and rodent. In human and monkey, the {ProS} and Sub extend into the uncal region anteriorly, and the {PoS} and {PaS} reach the cingulate isthmus posteriorly. In rodent, most of the typical subicular cortices are located in the dorsal and caudal portions of the hippocampal formation, and the modified version of the ventral {ProS} and Sub corresponds to the modified description of the uncal {ProS} and Sub in monkey and human. An interesting triangular region in rodent located at the juncture of the {PoS}, {PaS}, retrosplenial cortex, and visual cortex appears to be the equivalent of the monkey area prostriata. Major connections of the five subicular cortices are also summarized based on unified criteria discussed in this review, with distinct connections revealed between the {ProS} and the Sub. J. Comp.

To assess the effectiveness of a non-pharmacological intervention in patients with asthma on conventional therapy including inhaled corticosteroid.
Design
A randomised controlled trial of the Buteyko technique in a group of adults with asthma. The control group was trained by a physiotherapist in breathing and relaxation techniques.
Setting
A single centre associated with a University-based asthma programme.
Main outcome measure
Asthma control, defined by a composite score based on the Canadian asthma consensus report 6 months after completion of the intervention.
Results
Both groups showed substantial and similar improvement and a high proportion with asthma control 6 months after completion of the intervention. In the Buteyko group the proportion with asthma control increased from 40\% to 79\% and in the control group from 44\% to 72\%. In addition the Buteyko group had significantly reduced their inhaled corticosteroid therapy compared with the control group (p=0.02). None of the other differences between the groups at 6 months were significant.
Conclusions
Six months after completion of the interventions, a large majority of subjects in each group displayed control of their asthma with the additional benefit of reduction in inhaled corticosteroid use in the Buteyko group. The Buteyko technique, an established and widely recognised intervention, or an intensive programme delivered by a chest physiotherapist appear to provide additional benefit for adult patients with asthma who are being treated with inhaled corticosteroid.},

	abstract = {The vestibulo-ocular reflex ({VOR}) is characterized by a short-latency, high-fidelity eye movement response to head rotations at frequencies up to 20 Hz. Electrophysiological studies of medial vestibular nucleus ({MVN}) neurons, however, show that their response to sinusoidal currents above 10 to 12 Hz is highly nonlinear and distorted by aliasing for all but very small current amplitudes. How can this system function in vivo when single cell response cannot explain its operation? Here we show that the necessary wide {VOR} frequency response may be achieved not by firing rate encoding of head velocity in single neurons, but in the integrated population response of asynchronously firing, intrinsically active neurons. Diffusive synaptic noise and the pacemaker-driven, intrinsic firing of {MVN} cells synergistically maintain asynchronous, spontaneous spiking in a population of model {MVN} neurons over a wide range of input signal amplitudes and frequencies. Response fidelity is further improved by a reciprocal inhibitory link between two {MVN} populations, mimicking the vestibular commissural system in vivo, but only if asynchrony is maintained by noise and pacemaker inputs. These results provide a previously missing explanation for the full range of {VOR} function and a novel account of the role of the intrinsic pacemaker conductances in {MVN} cells. The values of diffusive noise and pacemaker currents that give optimal response fidelity yield firing statistics similar to those in vivo, suggesting that the in vivo network is tuned to optimal performance. While theoretical studies have argued that noise and population heterogeneity can improve coding, to our knowledge this is the first evidence indicating that these parameters are indeed tuned to optimize coding fidelity in a neural control system in vivo.},

We present a complex-valued firing-rate model derived from an eigenfunction expansion of the Fokker-Planck equation and apply it to the linear, quadratic and exponential integrate-and-fire models. Despite being almost as simple as a traditional firing-rate description, this model can reproduce firing-rate dynamics due to partial synchronization of the action potentials in a spiking model, and it successfully predicts the transition to spike synchronization in networks of coupled excitatory and inhibitory neurons.},

We give an analytical criterion to distinguish between continuous adaption, initial bursting, regular bursting and two types of tonic spiking. Also, we report that the deterministic model is capable of producing irregular spiking when stimulated with constant current, indicating low-dimensional chaos. Lastly, the simple model is fitted to real experiments of cortical neurons under step current stimulation.

	abstract = {Neurons transform time-varying inputs into action potentials emitted stochastically at a time dependent rate. The mapping from current input to output firing rate is often represented with the help of phenomenological models such as the linear-nonlinear ({LN}) cascade, in which the output firing rate is estimated by applying to the input successively a linear temporal filter and a static non-linear transformation. These simplified models leave out the biophysical details of action potential generation. It is not a priori clear to which extent the input-output mapping of biophysically more realistic, spiking neuron models can be reduced to a simple linear-nonlinear cascade. Here we investigate this question for the leaky integrate-and-fire ({LIF}), exponential integrate-and-fire ({EIF}) and conductance-based Wang-Buzsáki models in presence of background synaptic activity. We exploit available analytic results for these models to determine the corresponding linear filter and static non-linearity in a parameter-free form. We show that the obtained functions are identical to the linear filter and static non-linearity determined using standard reverse correlation analysis. We then quantitatively compare the output of the corresponding linear-nonlinear cascade with numerical simulations of spiking neurons, systematically varying the parameters of input signal and background noise. We find that the {LN} cascade provides accurate estimates of the firing rates of spiking neurons in most of parameter space. For the {EIF} and Wang-Buzsáki models, we show that the {LN} cascade can be reduced to a firing rate model, the timescale of which we determine analytically. Finally we introduce an adaptive timescale rate model in which the timescale of the linear filter depends on the instantaneous firing rate. This model leads to highly accurate estimates of instantaneous firing rates.},

Pyramidal neurons are not all identical, but some shared functional principles can be identified. In particular, the existence of dendritic domains with distinct synaptic inputs, excitability, modulation and plasticity appears to be a common feature that allows synapses throughout the dendritic tree to contribute to actionpotential generation. These properties support a variety of coincidence-detection mechanisms, which are likely to be crucial for synaptic integration and plasticity.},

	abstract = {Hippocampal region {CA}1 seems from comparative studies to be particularly important in the primate brain, in addition to being crucial to memory function. Thus, it is an extremely appropriate place to begin a quantitative investigation of the information representation and transmission capabilities of cerebral neural networks. In this study, a mathematical model of the Schaffer collateral projection from {CA}3 to {CA}1 is described. From the model, the amount of information that can be conveyed by the Schaffer collaterals is calculated, i.e., the information that a pattern of ﬁring in {CA}1 conveys about a pattern of ﬁring in {CA}3, because of the connections between them. The calculation is performed analytically for an arbitrary probability distribution describing the pattern of {CA}3 ﬁring and then solved numerically for particular input distributions. The effect of a number of issues on the information conveyed is examined. Consideration of the effect of the amount of analog resolution of ﬁring rates in the patterns of activity in {CA}3 conﬁrmed information transmission to be most efficient for binary codes, to a degree that depends on the sparseness of activity. For very sparse codes, a binary code allows more information to be received even in absolute terms, but for more distributed codes, slightly more information can be received by {CA}1 by making use of analog resolution. The pattern of convergence of connections from {CA}3 to {CA}1 is examined, i.e., the spatial distribution of the number of connections each {CA}1 neuron receives. It is found that the effect of the difference between a uniform convergence model and a proposed real convergence pattern (Bernard and Wheal, Hippocampus 1994;4:497–529) is minimal. The effect of the ratio of expansion between {CA}3 and {CA}1 due to the relative numbers of neurons in these two areas is studied. The Schaffer collaterals in all mammalian species reported in the literature seem to operate in a re´gime in which there is at least the scope for efficient transfer of information. In addition, the effect of topography (with respect to the transverse hippocampal axis) in the Schaffer collateral connectivity is examined. In the absence of spatial correlations, topography is found to have essentially no effect on information transmission. If spatial correlations in ﬁring were present in {CA}3 (which, however, would be less efficient for memory storage in the recurrent collaterals), information transmission would be maximized by matching the topographic spread to the spatial scale of correlation.

	abstract = {Theta oscillations are essential for learning and memory, and their generation requires {GABAergic} interneurons. To better understand how theta is generated, we explored how parvalbumin ({PV}) and somatostatin ({SOM}) interneurons in {CA}1 stratum oriens/alveus fire during hippocampal theta and investigated synaptic mechanisms underlying their behavior. Combining the use of transgenic mice to visually identify {PV} and {SOM} interneurons and the intact hippocampal preparation that can generate theta oscillations in vitro without cholinergic agonists, we performed simultaneous field and whole-cell recordings. We found that {PV} interneurons uniformly fire strongly phase-locked to theta, whereas {SOM} neurons are more heterogeneous with only a proportion of cells displaying tight phase-locking. Differences in phase-locking strength could be explained by disparity in excitatory inputs received; {PV} neurons received significantly larger {EPSCs} compared with {SOM} neurons, and the degree of phase-locking in {SOM} neurons was significantly correlated with the size of {EPSCs}. In contrast, {IPSC} amplitude did not differ between cell types. We determined that the local {CA}1 rhythm plays a more dominant role in driving {CA}1 interneuron firing than afferent inputs from the {CA}3. Last, we show that {PV} and strongly phase-locked {SOM} neurons fire near the peak of {CA}1 theta, under the tight control of excitatory inputs that arise at a specific phase of each theta cycle. These results reveal a fundamental mechanism of neuronal phase-locking and highlight an important role of excitation from the local network in governing firing behavior during rhythmic network states.
{SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT} Rhythmic activity in the theta range (3–12 Hz) is important for proper functioning of the hippocampus, a brain area essential for learning and memory. To understand how theta rhythm is generated, we investigated how two types of inhibitory neurons, those that express parvalbumin and somatostatin, fire action potentials during theta in an in vitro preparation of the mouse hippocampus. We found that the amount of excitatory input they receive from the local network determines how closely their spikes follow the network theta rhythm. Our findings reveal an important role of local excitatory input in driving inhibitory neuron firing during rhythmic states and may have implications for diseases, such as epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease, which affect the hippocampus and related areas.},

The late response – the population excitatory postsynaptic potential with a preceding transient potential, often biphasic – occurred only after an early population spike and was time-locked to it. The shape characteristics of the late response, its polarity, and its latent period relative to the early population spike suggest that stimulation of Shäffer collaterals gives rise, in {CA}1, to a wave of excitation which passes through the entorhinal cortex and returns to {CA}1 directly via fibers of the perforant path. In conscious rats, medium-strength stimulation of Shäffer collaterals, sufficient to evoke a quite early population spike in {CA}1, did not usually lead to the appearance of a late response; the same stimulation became effective after tetanization of Shäffer collaterals in conditions of long-term potentiation of the early population spike. Furthermore, the appearance of the late response was facilitated in rats falling asleep on the background of high-amplitude, low-frequency {EEG} oscillations in {CA}1 characteristic of slow-wave sleep, as well as in sleeping rats, regardless of the {EEG} pattern.},

Based on established neurophysiologic ﬁndings, astrocytes dynamically regulate the synaptic transmission of neuronal networks. The employed structure is based on the main physiological and anatomical features of the {CA}1 subﬁeld of the hippocampus. Utilizing our model, we demonstrate that healthy astrocytes provide appropriate feedback control in regulating neural activity. In this way, the astrocytes compensate the increase of excitation coupling strength among neurons and stabilize the normal level of synchronized behavior. Next, malfunction of astrocytes in the regulatory feedback loop is investigated. In this way, pathologic astrocytes are no longer able to regulate and/or compensate the excessive increase of the excitation level. Consequently, disruption of astrocyte signaling initiates hypersynchronous ﬁring of neurons. Our results suggest that diminishing of neuron–astrocyte cross-talk leads to an abnormal synchronized neuronal ﬁring, which suggests that astrocytes could be a proximal target for the treatment of related disorders including epilepsy.},

	abstract = {Hippocampal sharp wave-ripple complexes ({SWRs}) involve the synchronous discharge of thousands of cells throughout the {CA}3-{CA}1-subiculum-entorhinal cortex axis. Their strong transient output affects cortical targets, rendering {SWRs} a possible means for memory transfer from the hippocampus to the neocortex for long-term storage. Neurophysiological observations of hippocampal activity modulation by the cortical slow oscillation ({SO}) during deep sleep and anesthesia, and correlations between ripples and {UP} states, support the role of {SWRs} in memory consolidation through a cortico-hippocampal feedback loop. We couple a cortical network exhibiting {SO} with a hippocampal {CA}3-{CA}1 computational network model exhibiting {SWRs}, in order to model such cortico-hippocampal correlations and uncover important parameters and coupling mechanisms controlling them. The cortical oscillatory output entrains the {CA}3 network via connections representing the mossy fiber input, and the {CA}1 network via the temporoammonic pathway. The spiking activity in {CA}3 and {CA}1 is shown to depend on the excitation-to-inhibition ratio, induced by combining the two hippocampal inputs, with mossy fiber input controlling the {UP}-state correlation of {CA}3 population bursts and corresponding {SWRs}, whereas the temporoammonic input affects the overall {CA}1 spiking activity. Ripple characteristics and pyramidal spiking participation to {SWRs} are shaped by the strength of the Schaffer collateral drive. A set of in vivo recordings from the rat hippocampus confirms a model-predicted segregation of pyramidal cells into subgroups according to the {SO} state where they preferentially fire and their response to {SWRs}. These groups can potentially play distinct functional roles in the replay of spike sequences.},

As a result, a profusion of studies has tried to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these forms of plasticity. Traditionally, experience-dependent changes at excitatory synapses were assumed to underlie learning and memory formation. However, with the relatively more recent investigation of inhibitory transmission, it had become evident that inhibitory synapses are not only plastic, but also provide an additional way to modulate excitatory transmission and the induction of plasticity at excitatory synapses.Thanks to recent technological advances, progress has been made in understanding synaptic transmission and plasticity from particular interneuron subtypes. In this review article, we will describe various forms of synaptic plasticity that have been ascribed to two fairly well characterized populations of interneurons in the hippocampus, those expressing cholecystokinin ({CCK}) and parvalbumin ({PV}). We will discuss the resulting changes in the strength and plasticity of excitatory transmission that occur in the local circuit as a result of the modulation of inhibitory transmission. We will focus on the hippocampus because this region has a relatively well-understood circuitry, numerous forms of activity-dependent plasticity and a multitude of identified interneuron subclasses.},

	abstract = {We propose a macroscopic approach toward realistic simulations of the population activity of hippocampal pyramidal neurons, based on the known refractory density equation with a different hazard function and on a different single-neuron threshold model. The threshold model is a conductance-based model taking into account adaptation-providing currents, which is reduced by omitting the fast sodium current and instead using an explicit threshold criterion for action potential events. Compared to the full pyramidal neuron model, the threshold model well approximates spike-time moments, postspike refractory states, and postsynaptic current integration. The dynamics of a neural population continuum are described by a set of one-dimensional partial differential equations in terms of the distributions of the refractory density (where the refractory state is defined by the time elapsed since the last action potential), the membrane potential, and the gating variables of the voltage-dependent channels, across the entire population. As the source term in the density equation, the probability density of firing, or hazard function, is derived from the Fokker-Planck ({FP}) equation, assuming that a single neuron is governed by a deterministic average-across-population input and a noise term. A self-similar solution of the {FP} equation in the subthreshold regime is obtained. Responses of the ensemble to stimulation by a current step and oscillating current are simulated and compared with individual neuron simulations. An example of interictal-like activity of a population of all-to-all connected excitatory neurons is presented.},

	abstract = {Hippocampal place fields form a neuronal map of the spatial environment. In addition, the distance between two place field centers is proportional to the firing phase difference of two place cells with respect to the local theta rhythm. This consistency between spatial distance and theta phase is generally assumed to result from hippocampal phase precession: The firing phase of a place cell decreases with distance traveled in the place field. The rate of phase precession depends on place field width such that the phase range covered in a traversal of a place field is independent of field width. Width-dependent precession rates, however, generally disrupt the consistency between distance and phase differences. In this paper we provide a mathematical theory suggesting that this consistency can only be secured for different place field widths if phase precession starts at a width-dependent phase offset. These offsets are in accordance with the experimentally observed theta wave traveling from the dorsal to the ventral pole of the hippocampus. Furthermore the theory predicts that sequences of place cells with different widths should be ordered according to the end of the place field. The results also hold for considerably nonlinear phase precession profiles.},

	abstract = {Summary
A widely held memory consolidation theory posits that memory of events and space is initially stored in the hippocampus ({HPC}) in a time-limited manner and is consolidated in the neocortex for permanent storage. Although posttraining {HPC} lesions result in temporally graded amnesia, the precise {HPC} circuits and mechanisms involved in remote memory storage remain poorly understood. To investigate the role of the trisynaptic pathway in the consolidation process we employed the {CA}3-{TeTX} transgenic mouse, in which {CA}3 output can be specifically and inducibly controlled. We found that posttraining blockade of {CA}3 output for up to 4 weeks impairs the consolidation of contextual fear memory. Moreover, in vivo hippocampal recordings revealed a reduced intrinsic frequency of {CA}1 ripples and a significant decrease in the experience-dependent, ripple-associated coordinated reactivation of {CA}1 cell pairs. Collectively, these results suggest that the posttraining integrity of the trisynaptic pathway and the ripple-associated reactivation of hippocampal memory engram are crucial for memory consolidation.},

	abstract = {In model networks of E-cells and I-cells (excitatory and inhibitory neurons, respectively), synchronous rhythmic spiking often comes about from the interplay between the two cell groups: the E-cells synchronize the I-cells and vice versa. Under ideal conditions-homogeneity in relevant network parameters and all-to-all connectivity, for instance-this mechanism can yield perfect synchronization. We find that approximate, imperfect synchronization is possible even with very sparse, random connectivity. The crucial quantity is the expected number of inputs per cell. As long as it is large enough (more precisely, as long as the variance of the total number of synaptic inputs per cell is small enough), tight synchronization is possible. The desynchronizing effect of random connectivity can be reduced by strengthening the E --{\textgreater} I synapses. More surprising, it cannot be reduced by strengthening the I --{\textgreater} E synapses. However, the decay time constant of inhibition plays an important role. Faster decay yields tighter synchrony. In particular, in models in which the inhibitory synapses are assumed to be instantaneous, the effects of sparse, random connectivity cannot be seen.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have implicated astrocytes in multiple active roles in neuronal networks. In particular they have been shown to be able to moderate and alter neural firing patterns both in normal and epileptic conditions. In addition, it has been proposed that one of the roles of gap junctions between astrocytes, as well as neurons is in increasing synchronization of neuronal firing and potential epileptogenic effect. In this study we build upon a model of a network that incorporates both pyramidal cells and interneurons as well as astrocytes with potassium clearance mechanisms and basic calcium dynamics. We include electrotonic connections between cells to be able to separate the effects of synaptic connections and gap junctions on neuronal hyperexcitability. Preliminary findings of this model show that under normal conditions, when gap junctions are blocked the network exists in an interictal-like state. When the system is put in a zero calcium environment (i.e. synaptic connections are disabled), the network enters spontaneous rhythmic bursting with very regular spiking. This suggests that electrotonic connections play a crucial role in the epileptogenesis within the neuronal network.},

	abstract = {Epilepsy is a network phenomenon characterized by atypical activity at the neuronal and population levels during seizures, including tonic spiking, increased heterogeneity in spiking rates, and synchronization. The etiology of epilepsy is unclear, but a common theme among proposed mechanisms is that structural connectivity between neurons is altered. It is hypothesized that epilepsy arises not from random changes in connectivity, but from specific structural changes to the most fragile nodes or neurons in the network. In this letter, the minimum energy perturbation on functional connectivity required to destabilize linear networks is derived. Perturbation results are then applied to a probabilistic nonlinear neural network model that operates at a stable fixed point. That is, if a small stimulus is applied to the network, the activation probabilities of each neuron respond transiently but eventually recover to their baseline values. When the perturbed network is destabilized, the activation probabilities shift to larger or smaller values or oscillate when a small stimulus is applied. Finally, the structural modifications to the neural network that achieve the functional perturbation are derived. Simulations of the unperturbed and perturbed networks qualitatively reflect neuronal activity observed in epilepsy patients, suggesting that the changes in network dynamics due to destabilizing perturbations, including the emergence of an unstable manifold or a stable limit cycle, may be indicative of neuronal or population dynamics during seizure. That is, the epileptic cortex is always on the brink of instability and minute changes in the synaptic weights associated with the most fragile node can suddenly destabilize the network to cause seizures. Finally, the theory developed here and its interpretation of epileptic networks enables the design of a straightforward feedback controller that first detects when the network has destabilized and then applies linear state feedback control to steer the network back to its stable state.},

We demonstrate the method using stationary and time dependent inputs, and compare them with Monte Carlo simulations. Such simulations are relatively easy to implement, but can suffer from convergence difficulties and long run times. In comparison, our method offers improved accuracy, and decreases computation times by several orders of magnitude.

	abstract = {Cholinergic inputs from the basal forebrain regulate multiple olfactory bulb ({OB}) functions including odor discrimination, perceptual learning, and short term memory. Previous studies have shown that nicotinic cholinergic receptor activation sharpens mitral cell chemoreceptive fields, likely via intraglomerular circuitry. Muscarinic cholinergic activation is less well understood, though muscarinic receptors are implicated in olfactory learning and in the regulation of synchronized oscillatory dynamics in hippocampus and cortex. To understand the mechanisms underlying cholinergic neuromodulation in {OB}, we developed a biophysical model of the {OB} neuronal network including both glomerular layer and external plexiform layer ({EPL}) computations and incorporating both nicotinic and muscarinic neuromodulatory effects. Our simulations show how nicotinic activation within glomerular circuits sharpens mitral cell chemoreceptive fields, even in the absence of {EPL} circuitry, but does not facilitate intrinsic oscillations or spike synchronization. In contrast, muscarinic receptor activation increases mitral cell spike synchronization and field oscillatory power by potentiating granule cell excitability and lateral inhibitory interactions within the {EPL}, but has little effect on mitral cell firing rates and hence will not sharpen olfactory representations under a rate metric. These results are consistent with the theory that {EPL} interactions regulate the timing, rather than the existence, of mitral cell action potentials, and perform their computations with respect to a spike timing-based metric. This general model suggests that the roles of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors in olfactory bulb are both distinct and complementary to one another, together regulating the effects of ascending cholinergic inputs on olfactory bulb transformations.},

We apply phase reduction and averaging methods to a corresponding Langevin approximation of the master equation in order to determine how intrinsic noise disrupts synchronization of the population oscillators driven by a common extrinsic noise source. We illustrate our analysis by considering one of the simplest networks known to generate limit cycle oscillations at the population level, namely, a pair of mutually coupled excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) subpopulations. We show how the combination of intrinsic independent noise and extrinsic common noise can lead to clustering of the population oscillators due to the multiplicative nature of both noise sources under the Langevin approximation. Finally, we show how a similar analysis can be carried out for another simple population model that exhibits limit cycle oscillations in the deterministic limit, namely, a recurrent excitatory network with synaptic depression; inclusion of synaptic depression into the neural master equation now generates a stochastic hybrid system.},

It is well documented that anxiolytic drugs diminish septo-hippocampal oscillatory θ activity contributing to their either therapeutic or unwanted side effects. In the present experiments we applied a combination of computational and physiological techniques to explore the functional role of {GABAA} receptors in θ oscillation. In electrophysiological experiments extracellular single unit recordings were performed from medial septum/diagonal band of Broca with simultaneous hippocampal ({CA}1) electroencephalogram ({EEG}) recordings from anesthetized rats. Neurotransmission at {GABAA} receptors were modulated by means of pharmacological tools: the actions of the {GABAA} receptor positive allosteric modulator diazepam and inverse agonist/negative allosteric modulator {FG}-7142 were evaluated on septo-hippocampal activity. Systemic administration of diazepam inhibited, whereas {FG}-7142 enhanced θ oscillation of septal neurons and hippocampal {EEG} θ activity. In parallel to these experimental observations, a computational model has been constructed by implementing a septal {GABA} neuron model with a {CA}1 hippocampal model containing three types of neurons (including oriens and basket interneurons and pyramidal cells; latter modeled by multicompartmental techniques; for detailed model description with network parameters see online addendum: http://geza.kzoo.edu/theta). This connectivity made the network capable of simulating the responses of the septo-hippocampal circuitry to the modulation of {GABAA} transmission, and the presently described computational model proved suitable to reveal several aspects of pharmacological modulation of {GABAA} receptors. In addition, computational findings indicated different roles of distinctively located {GABAA} receptors in θ generation.},

	abstract = {Glutathione ({GSH}) has a crucial role in cellular signaling and antioxidant defenses either by reacting directly with reactive oxygen or nitrogen species or by acting as an essential cofactor for {GSH} S-transferases and glutathione peroxidases. {GSH} acting in concert with its dependent enzymes, known as the glutathione system, is responsible for the detoxification of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species ({ROS}/{RNS}) and electrophiles produced by xenobiotics. Adequate levels of {GSH} are essential for the optimal functioning of the immune system in general and T cell activation and differentiation in particular. {GSH} is a ubiquitous regulator of the cell cycle per se. {GSH} also has crucial functions in the brain as an antioxidant, neuromodulator, neurotransmitter, and enabler of neuron survival. Depletion of {GSH} leads to exacerbation of damage by oxidative and nitrosative stress; hypernitrosylation; increased levels of proinflammatory mediators and inflammatory potential; dysfunctions of intracellular signaling networks, e.g., p53, nuclear factor-κB, and Janus kinases; decreased cell proliferation and {DNA} synthesis; inactivation of complex I of the electron transport chain; activation of cytochrome c and the apoptotic machinery; blockade of the methionine cycle; and compromised epigenetic regulation of gene expression. As such, {GSH} depletion has marked consequences for the homeostatic control of the immune system, oxidative and nitrosative stress (O\&{NS}) pathways, regulation of energy production, and mitochondrial survival as well. {GSH} depletion and concomitant increase in O\&{NS} and mitochondrial dysfunctions play a role in the pathophysiology of diverse neuroimmune disorders, including depression, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and Parkinson's disease, suggesting that depleted {GSH} is an integral part of these diseases. Therapeutical interventions that aim to increase {GSH} concentrations in vivo include N-acetyl cysteine; Nrf-2 activation via hyperbaric oxygen therapy; dimethyl fumarate; phytochemicals, including curcumin, resveratrol, and cinnamon; and folate supplementation.},

	abstract = {Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome ({ME}/cfs) is classified by the World Health Organization as a disorder of the central nervous system. {ME}/cfs is an neuro-immune disorder accompanied by chronic low-grade inflammation, increased levels of oxidative and nitrosative stress (O\&{NS}), O\&{NS}-mediated damage to fatty acids, {DNA} and proteins, autoimmune reactions directed against neoantigens and brain disorders. Mitochondrial dysfunctions have been found in {ME}/cfs, e.g. lowered {ATP} production, impaired oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial damage. This paper reviews the pathways that may explain mitochondrial dysfunctions in {ME}/cfs. Increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α, and elastase, and increased O\&{NS} may inhibit mitochondrial respiration, decrease the activities of the electron transport chain and mitochondrial membrane potential, increase mitochondrial membrane permeability, interfere with {ATP} production and cause mitochondrial shutdown. The activated O\&{NS} pathways may additionally lead to damage of mitochondrial {DNA} and membranes thus decreasing membrane fluidity. Lowered levels of antioxidants, zinc and coenzyme Q10, and ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in {ME}/cfs may further aggravate the activated immuno-inflammatory and O\&{NS} pathways. Therefore, it may be concluded that immuno-inflammatory and O\&{NS} pathways may play a role in the mitochondrial dysfunctions and consequently the bioenergetic abnormalities seen in patients with {ME}/cfs. Defects in {ATP} production and the electron transport complex, in turn, are associated with an elevated production of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in mitochondria creating adaptive and synergistic damage. It is argued that mitochondrial dysfunctions, e.g. lowered {ATP} production, may play a role in the onset of {ME}/cfs symptoms, e.g. fatigue and post exertional malaise, and may explain in part the central metabolic abnormalities observed in {ME}/cfs, e.g. glucose hypometabolism and cerebral hypoperfusion.},

	abstract = {The study of mediation of treatment effects, or how treatments work, is important to understanding and improving psychological and behavioral treatments, but applications often focus on mediators and outcomes measured at a single time point. Such cross-sectional analyses do not respect the implied temporal ordering that mediation suggests. Clinical trials of treatments often provide repeated measures of outcomes and, increasingly, of mediators as well. Repeated measurements allow the application of various types of longitudinal structural equation mediation models. These provide flexibility in modeling, including the ability to incorporate some types of measurement error and unmeasured confounding that can strengthen the robustness of findings. The usual approach is to identify the most theoretically plausible model and apply that model. In the absence of clear theory, we put forward the option of fitting a few theoretically plausible models, providing a type of sensitivity analysis for the mediation hypothesis. In this tutorial, we outline how to fit several longitudinal mediation models, including simplex, latent growth and latent change models. This will allow readers to learn about one type of model that is of interest, or about several alternative models, so that they can take this sensitivity approach. We use the Pacing, Graded Activity, and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: A Randomized Evaluation ({PACE}) trial of rehabilitative treatments for chronic fatigue syndrome ({ISRCTN} 54285094) as a motivating example and describe how to fit and interpret various longitudinal mediation models using simulated data similar to those in the {PACE} trial.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Cytokine disturbances have been suggested to be associated with the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic encephalomyelitis ({CFS}/{ME}) for decades.
{METHODS}: Fifty female {CFS} patients were included in a study on the effect of the interleukin-1-receptor antagonist anakinra or placebo during 4 weeks. {EDTA} plasma was collected from patients before and directly after treatment. At baseline, plasma samples were collected at the same time from 48 healthy, age-matched female neighborhood controls. A panel of 92 inflammatory markers was determined in parallel in 1 μL samples using a 'proximity extension assay' ({PEA}) based immunoassay. Since Transforming growth factor beta ({TGF}-β) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist ({IL}-1Ra) were not included in this platform, these cytokines were measured with {ELISA}.
{RESULTS}: In {CFS}/{ME} patients, the 'normalized protein expression' value of {IL}-12p40 and {CSF}-1 was significantly higher (p value 0.0042 and 0.049, respectively). Furthermore, using {LASSO} regression, a combination of 47 markers yielded a prediction model with a corrected {AUC} of 0.73. After correction for multiple testing, anakinra had no effect on circulating cytokines. {TGF}-β did not differ between patients and controls.
{CONCLUSIONS}: In conclusion, this study demonstrated increased {IL}-12p40 and {CSF}-1 concentrations in {CFS}/{ME} patients in addition to a set of predictive biomarkers. There was no effect of anakinra on circulating cytokines other than {IL}-1Ra.

	abstract = {The medial septum ({MS}) plays an essential role in rhythmogenesis in the hippocampus ({HIPP}); theta-rhythmic bursts of {MS} neurons are believed to drive theta oscillations in rats’ {HIPP}. The {MS} theta pacemaker hypothesis has solid foundation but the {MS}-hippocampal interactions during different behavioral states are poorly understood. The {MS} and the {HIPP} have reciprocal connections and it is not clear in particular what role, if any, the strong {HIPP} to {MS} projection plays in theta generation. To study the functional interactions between {MS} and {HIPP} during different behavioral states, this study investigated the relationship between {MS} single-unit activity and {HIPP} field potential oscillations during theta states of active waking and {REM} sleep and non-theta states of slow wave sleep and quiet waking, i.e., sleep-wake states that comprise the full behavioral repertoire of undisturbed, freely moving rats. We used non-parametric Granger causality ({GC}) to decompose the {MS}-{HIPP} synchrony into its directional components, {MS}{HIPP} and {HIPP}{MS}, and to examine the causal interactions between them within the theta frequency band. We found a significant unidirectional {MS}{HIPP} influence in non-theta states which switches to bidirectional theta drive during theta states with {MS}{HIPP} and {HIPP}{MS} {GC} being of equal magnitude. In non-theta states, unidirectional {MS}{HIPP} influence was accompanied by significant {MS}-{HIPP} coherence, but no signs of theta oscillations in the {HIPP}. In theta states of active waking and {REM} sleep, sharp theta coherence and strong theta power in both structures was associated with a rise in {HIPP}{MS} to the level of the {MS}{HIPP} drive. Thus, striking differences between waking and {REM} sleep theta states and non-theta states of slow wave sleep and quiet waking were primarily observed in activation of theta influence carried by the descending {HIPP}{MS} pathway associated with more regular rhythmic bursts in the {MS} and sharper {MS}{HIPP} {GC} spectra without a significant increase in {MS}{HIPP} {GC} magnitude. The results of this study suggest an essential role of descending {HIPP} to {MS} projections in theta generation.},

To address this issue, a brief overview of immune maturation in humans is provided to demonstrate that functional immaturity alone predisposes the young to infection. Age-dependent differences in the immunotoxic effects of five diverse compounds, diethylstilbestrol ({DES}), diazepam ({DZP}), lead (Pb), 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ({TCDD}), and tributyltin oxide ({TBTO}), which have undergone adult and developmental immunotoxicity testing in rodents, are then reviewed, as are human data when available. For all five chemicals, the developing immune system was found to be at greater risk than that of the adult, either because lower doses produced immunotoxicity, adverse effects were more persistent, or both.},

	abstract = {Chronic fatigue syndrome ({CFS}), also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis ({ME}) in some countries, is a debilitating disease with a constellation of multi-system dysfunctions primarily involving the neurological, endocrine and immune systems. While substantial information is available concerning the complex dysfunction-associated symptoms of {CFS}, environmental origins of the disease have yet to be determined. Part of the dilemma in identifying the cause(s) has been the focus on biomarkers (hormones, neurotransmitters, cytokines, infectious agents) that are contemporary with later-life {CFS} episodes. Yet, recent investigations on the origins of environmental diseases of the neurological, endocrine, reproductive, respiratory and immune systems suggest that early life toxicologic and other insults are pivotal in producing later-life onset of symptoms. As with autism and childhood asthma, {CFS} can also occur in children where the causes are certainly early-life events. Immune dysfunction is recognized as part of the {CFS} phenotype but has received comparatively less attention than aberrant neurological or endocrine function. However, recent research results suggest that early life immune insults ({ELII}) including developmental immunotoxicity ({DIT}), which is induced by xenobiotics, may offer an important clue to the origin(s) of {CFS}. The developing immune system is a sensitive and novel target for environmental insult (xenobiotic, infectious agents, stress) with major ramifications for postnatal health risks. Additionally, many prenatal and early postnatal neurological lesions associated with postnatal neurobehavioral diseases are now recognized as linked to prenatal immune insult and inflammatory dysregulation. This review considers the potential role of {ELII} including {DIT} as an early-life component of later-life {CFS}.},

	abstract = {Chronic fatigue syndrome ({CFS}) is a specific clinical condition that characterises unexplained disabling fatigue and a combination of non-specific accompanying symptoms for at least 6 months, in the absence of a medical diagnosis that would otherwise explain the clinical presentation. Other common symptoms include headaches, myalgia, arthralgia, and post-exertional malaise; cognitive difficulties, with impaired memory and concentration; unrefreshing sleep; and mood changes. Similar disorders have been described for at least two centuries and have been differently named neurasthenia, post-viral fatigue, myalgic encephalomyelitis and chronic mononucleosis. Recent longitudinal studies suggest that some people affected by chronic fatigue syndrome improve with time but that most remain functionally impaired for several years. The estimated worldwide prevalence of {CFS} is 0.4-1\% and it affects over 800,000 people in the United States and approximately 240,000 patients in the {UK}. No physical examination signs are specific to {CFS} and no diagnostic tests identify this syndrome. The pathophysiological mechanism of {CFS} is unclear. The main hypotheses include altered central nervous system functioning resulting from an abnormal immune response against a common antigen; a neuroendocrine disturbance; cognitive impairment caused by response to infection or other stimuli in sentient people. The current concept is that {CFS} pathogenesis is a multifactorial condition. Various studies have sought evidence for a disturbance in immunity in people with {CFS}. An alteration in cytokine profile, a decreased function of natural killer ({NK}) cells, a presence of autoantibodies and a reduced responses of T cells to mitogens and other specific antigens have been reported. The observed high level of pro-inflammatory cytokines may explain some of the manifestations such as fatigue and flu-like symptoms and influence {NK} activity. Abnormal activation of the T lymphocyte subsets and a decrease in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity have been described. An increased number of {CD}8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes and {CD}38 and {HLA}-{DR} activation markers have been reported, and a decrease in {CD}11b expression associated with an increased expression of {CD}28+ T subsets has been observed.

Complex-spike bursts were more effective than single spikes. Single cell contribution was higher between {SPW} bursts than during {SPWs} or theta activity.

Attractor dynamics may explain both why neurons react coherently following sufficiently large changes to the environment (discrete attractors) and how firing patterns move smoothly from one representation to the next as an animal moves through space (continuous attractors). However, some features of place cell behavior, such as the sometimes independent responsiveness of place cells to environmental change (called "remapping"), seem hard to reconcile with attractor dynamics. This paper suggests that the explanation may be found in an anatomical separation of the two attractor systems coupled with a dynamic contextual modulation of the connection matrix between the two systems, with new learning being back-propagated into the matrix. Such a scheme could explain how place cells sometimes behave coherently and sometimes independently.},

One question regards the function of entorhinal grid cells. We propose here that their fundamental function is to provide a coordinate system for producing mind-travel in the hippocampus, a process that accesses associations with upcoming positions. We further propose that mind-travel occurs during the second half of each theta cycle. By contrast, the first half of each theta cycle is devoted to computing current position using sensory information from the lateral entorhinal cortex ({LEC}) and path integration information from the medial entorhinal cortex ({MEC}). This model explains why lesions can abolish hippocampal phase precession but not place fields.},

	abstract = {Epileptic seizures occur less during wakefulness or paradoxical sleep, conditions during which hippocampal theta rhythm is seen. This leads to the hypothesis that this rhythm indicates a physiological state of the hippocampal formation which opposes its recruitment into seizures. This was tested by determining the effects of experimental induction or suppression of hippocampal theta activity on seizures. Hippocampal theta activity can be induced by chemical or electrical stimulation of the medial septal nucleus and adjacent nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca. Microinjections of the muscarinic agonist carbachol in the medial septum during pentylenetetrazol ({PTZ}) induced facial-forelimb seizures stopped behavioral seizures and {EEG} spiking within five seconds, and caused hippocampal theta activity. Medial septal electrical stimulation at 4-8 Hz had similar effects. Electrolytic medial septal lesions abolished hippocampal theta activity and lowered myoclonic and facial-forelimb {PTZ} seizure thresholds. Medial septal carbachol injections were also made during electrically kindled limbic status epilepticus. Within ten seconds, ictal behavior stopped and the {EEG} spike rate decreased by half with a gradual return to the baseline rate over three minutes. These results demonstrate that the hippocampal theta rhythm corresponds to a seizure-resistant condition, providing a possible explanation for the seizure promoting properties of slow wave sleep.},

	abstract = {Electrical stimulation of the septal nuclei via deep brain stimulating electrodes is proposed as a potentially beneficial therapy for medication-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. In a multicenter study, stimulation of anterior thalamus was shown to reduce numbers of seizures, but decrease was only in the range of 40\%. This might be improved with septal stimulation, which has strong and direct reciprocal connections with the hippocampal formation, the structure most involved in temporal lobe epilepsy. Medial septal neurons drive a 3–12Hz theta rhythm in hippocampus of rodents. Theta rhythm is less obvious in human hippocampus, but it is present and it varies with cognitive tasks. The hippocampal theta rhythm is disrupted by seizures. In animal models, restoration of theta by sensory stimulation, septal electrical stimulation or cholinergic drugs infused into septum ameliorates seizures. Seizure activity in hippocampus is faithfully reflected in septal nuclei, and septum sometimes leads the seizure activity. A subset of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy have structural enlargement of their septal nuclei. At high levels of intensity, septal stimulation is subjectively pleasurable and strongly reinforcing. Rats will repeatedly press a bar to stimulate their septum. Initial experience with human septal stimulation in the 1950s was not favorable, with ineffective therapy for schizophrenia and a high rate of surgical complications. Subsequent experience in 50–100 pain patients employing modern neurosurgical techniques was more favorable and demonstrated septal stimulation to be safe and tolerable. The current state of knowledge is sufficient to consider design of a clinical trial of medial septal stimulation in selected patients with medication-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy.},

So far, the functional properties of neurochemically identified {MS}-{DB} neurons are not fully characterized. In this study, {MS}-{DB} neurons recorded in urethane anesthetized rats and in unanesthetized restrained rats were labeled with neurobiotin and processed for immunohistochemistry against glutamic acid decarboxylase ({GAD}), parvalbumin ({PV}), and choline acetyltransferase ({ChAT}). The majority of the 90 labeled neurons (75.5\%) were {GAD}+. Among them, 34.0\% were also {PV}+, but none were {ChAT}+. Only 8.8\% of the labeled neurons were found {ChAT}+. Remaining neurons (15.5\%) were not identified. In anesthetized rats, all of the {PV}/{GAD}+ and 65\% of {GAD}+ neurons exhibited burst-firing activity at the theta frequency. {PV}/{GAD}+ neurons displayed higher discharge rate and longer burst duration compared with {GAD}+ neurons. At variance, all of the {ChAT}+ neurons were slow-firing. Cluster-firing and tonic-firing were observed in {GAD}+ and unidentified neurons. In unanesthetized rats, during wakefulness or rapid eye movement sleep with hippocampal theta, the bursting neurons were {PV}/{GAD}+ or {GAD}+, whereas all of the {ChAT}+ neurons were slow-firing. Across the sleep–wake cycle, the {GABAergic} component of the septohippocampal pathway was always more active than the cholinergic one. The fact that cholinergic {MS}-{DB} neurons do not display theta-related bursting or tonic activity but have a very low firing rate questions how acetylcholine exerts its activating role in the septohippocampal system.},

	abstract = {In the hippocampal {CA}1 area, a relatively homogenous population of pyramidal cells is accompanied by a diversity of {GABAergic} interneurons. Previously, we found that parvalbumin-expressing basket, axo-axonic, bistratified, and oriens-lacunosum moleculare cells, innervating different domains of pyramidal cells, have distinct firing patterns during network oscillations in vivo. A second family of interneurons, expressing cholecystokinin but not parvalbumin, is known to target the same domains of pyramidal cells as do the parvalbumin cells. To test the temporal activity of these independent and parallel {GABAergic} inputs, we recorded the precise spike timing of identified cholecystokinin interneurons during hippocampal network oscillations in anesthetized rats and determined their molecular expression profiles and synaptic targets. The cells were cannabinoid receptor type 1 immunopositive. Contrary to the stereotyped firing of parvalbumin interneurons, cholecystokinin-expressing basket and dendrite-innervating cells discharge, on average, with 1.7 ± 2.0 Hz during high-frequency ripple oscillations in an episode-dependent manner. During theta oscillations, cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons fire with 8.8 ± 3.3 Hz at a characteristic time on the ascending phase of theta waves (155 ± 81°), when place cells start firing in freely moving animals. The firing patterns of some interneurons recorded in drug-free behaving rats were similar to cholecystokinin cells in anesthetized animals. Our results demonstrate that cholecystokinin- and parvalbumin-expressing interneurons make different contributions to network oscillations and play distinct roles in different brain states. We suggest that the specific spike timing of cholecystokinin interneurons and their sensitivity to endocannabinoids might contribute to differentiate subgroups of pyramidal cells forming neuronal assemblies, whereas parvalbumin interneurons contribute to synchronizing the entire network.},

	abstract = {Hippocampal oscillations reflect coordinated neuronal activity on many timescales. Distinct types of {GABAergic} interneuron participate in the coordination of pyramidal cells over different oscillatory cycle phases. In the {CA}3 area, which generates sharp waves and gamma oscillations, the contribution of identified {GABAergic} neurons remains to be defined. We have examined the firing of a family of cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons during network oscillations in urethane-anesthetized rats and compared them with firing of {CA}3 pyramidal cells. The position of the terminals of individual visualized interneurons was highly diverse, selective, and often spatially coaligned with either the entorhinal or the associational inputs to area {CA}3. The spike timing in relation to theta and gamma oscillations and sharp waves was correlated with the innervated pyramidal cell domain. Basket and dendritic-layer-innervating interneurons receive entorhinal and associational inputs and preferentially fire on the ascending theta phase, when pyramidal cell assemblies emerge. Perforant-path-associated cells, driven by recurrent collaterals of pyramidal cells fire on theta troughs, when established pyramidal cell assemblies are most active. In the {CA}3 area, slow and fast gamma oscillations occurred on opposite theta oscillation phases. Perforant-path-associated and some {COUP}-{TFII}-positive interneurons are strongly coupled to both fast and slow gamma oscillations, but basket and dendritic-layer-innervating cells are weakly coupled to fast gamma oscillations only. During sharp waves, different interneuron types are activated, inhibited, or remain unaffected. We suggest that specialization in pyramidal cell domain and glutamatergic input-specific operations, reflected in the position of {GABAergic} terminals, is the evolutionary drive underlying the diversity of cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons.},

	abstract = {The entorhinal cortex ({EC}) is the major input and output structure of the hippocampal formation, forming the nodal point in cortico-hippocampal circuits. Different division schemes including two or many more subdivisions have been proposed, but here we will argue that subdividing {EC} into two components, the lateral ({LEC}) and medial {EC} ({MEC}) might suffice to describe the functional architecture of {EC}. This subdivision then leads to an anatomical interpretation of the different phenotypes of {LEC} and {MEC}. First, we will briefly summarize the cytoarchitectonic differences and differences in hippocampal projection patterns on which the subdivision between {LEC} and {MEC} traditionally is based and provide a short comparative perspective. Second, we focus on main differences in cortical connectivity, leading to the conclusion that the apparent differences may well correlate with the functional differences. Cortical connectivity of {MEC} is features interactions with areas such as the presubiculum, parasubiculum, retrosplenial cortex and postrhinal cortex, all areas that are considered to belong to the ’spatial processing domain’ of the cortex. In contrast, {LEC} is strongly connected with olfactory areas, insular, medial- and orbitofrontal areas and perirhinal cortex. These areas are likely more involved in processing of object information, attention and motivation. Third, we will compare the intrinsic networks involving principal- and inter-neurons in {LEC} and {MEC}. Together, these observations suggest that the different phenotypes of both {EC} subdivisions likely depend on the combination of intrinsic organization and specific sets of inputs. We further suggest a reappraisal of the notion of {EC} as a layered input-output structure for the hippocampal formation.},

	abstract = {The prevailing view of epileptic seizures is that they are caused by increased hypersynchronous activity in the cortical network. However, this view is based mostly on electroencephalography ({EEG}) recordings that do not directly monitor neuronal synchronization of action potential firing. In this study, we used multielectrode single-unit recordings from the hippocampus to investigate firing of individual {CA}1 neurons and directly monitor synchronization of action potential firing between neurons during the different ictal phases of chemoconvulsant-induced epileptic seizures in vivo. During the early phase of seizures manifesting as low-amplitude rhythmic β-electrocorticography ({ECoG}) activity, the firing frequency of most neurons markedly increased. To our surprise, the average overall neuronal synchronization as measured by the cross-correlation function was reduced compared with control conditions with ∼60\% of neuronal pairs showing no significant correlated firing. However, correlated firing was not uniform and a minority of neuronal pairs showed a high degree of correlated firing. Moreover, during the early phase of seizures, correlated firing between 9.8 ± 5.1\% of all stably recorded pairs increased compared with control conditions. As seizures progressed and high-frequency {ECoG} polyspikes developed, the firing frequency of neurons further increased and enhanced correlated firing was observed between virtually all neuronal pairs. These findings indicated that epileptic seizures represented a hyperactive state with widespread increase in action potential firing. Hypersynchrony also characterized seizures. However, it initially developed in a small subset of neurons and gradually spread to involve the entire cortical network only in the later more intense ictal phases.},

	abstract = {Correlations in the spiking activity of neurons have been found in many regions of the cortex under multiple experimental conditions and are postulated to have important consequences for neural population coding. While there is a large body of extracellular data reporting correlations of various strengths, the subthreshold events underlying the origin and magnitude of signal-independent correlations (called noise or spike count correlations) are unknown. Here we investigate, using intracellular recordings, how synaptic input correlations from shared presynaptic neurons translate into membrane potential and spike-output correlations. Using a pharmacologically activated thalamocortical slice preparation, we perform simultaneous recordings from pairs of layer {IV} neurons in the auditory cortex of mice and measure synaptic potentials/currents, membrane potentials, and spiking outputs. We calculate cross-correlations between excitatory and inhibitory inputs to investigate correlations emerging from the network. We furthermore evaluate membrane potential correlations near resting potential to study how excitation and inhibition combine and affect spike-output correlations. We demonstrate directly that excitation is correlated with inhibition thereby partially canceling each other and resulting in weak membrane potential and spiking correlations between neurons. Our data suggest that cortical networks are set up to partially cancel correlations emerging from the connections between neurons. This active decorrelation is achieved because excitation and inhibition closely track each other. Our results suggest that the numerous shared presynaptic inputs do not automatically lead to increased spiking correlations.},

It is believed that correlations are a consequence of shared inputs between nearby neurons and could severely constrain information decoding. Here we show theoretically that recurrent neural networks can generate an asynchronous state characterized by arbitrarily low mean spiking correlations despite substantial amounts of shared input. In this state, spontaneous fluctuations in the activity of excitatory and inhibitory populations accurately track each other, generating negative correlations in synaptic currents which cancel the effect of shared input. Near-zero mean correlations were seen experimentally in recordings from rodent neocortex in vivo. Our results suggest a re-examination of the sources underlying observed correlations and their functional consequences for information processing.},

However, oscillatory mechanisms involving both excitation and inhibition can generate non-synchronous yet coordinated firing patterns. Using simultaneous recordings from multiple layers of the entorhinal–hippocampal loop, we found that coactivation of principal cell pairs (synchrony) was lowest during exploration and rapid-eye-movement ({REM}) sleep, associated with theta oscillations, and highest in slow wave sleep. Individual principal neurons had a wide range of theta phase preference. Thus, while theta oscillations reduce population synchrony, they nevertheless coordinate the phase (temporal) distribution of neurons. As a result, multiple cell assemblies can nest within the period of the theta cycle.},

We recorded the spike-timing of identified parvalbumin ({PV})-expressing basket, axo-axonic, oriens-lacunosum moleculare (O-{LM}) interneurons, and pyramidal cells in the intermediate {CA}1 ({iCA}1) of anesthetized rats in relation to simultaneously detected network oscillations in {iCA}1 and dorsal {CA}1 ({dCA}1). Distinct interneuron types were coupled differentially to {SWR}, and the majority of {iCA}1 {SWR} events occurred simultaneously with {dCA}1 {SWR} events. In contrast, {iCA}1 theta oscillations were shifted in time relative to {dCA}1 theta oscillations. During theta cycles, the highest firing of {iCA}1 axo-axonic cells was followed by {PV}-expressing basket cells and subsequently by O-{LM} together with pyramidal cells, similar to the firing sequence of {dCA}1 cell types reported previously. However, we observed that this temporal organization of cell types is shifted in time between {dCA}1 and {iCA}1, together with the respective shift in theta oscillations. We show that {GABAergic} activity can be synchronized during {SWR} but is shifted in time from {dCA}1 to {iCA}1 during theta oscillations, highlighting the flexible inhibitory control of excitatory activity across a brain structure.},

	abstract = {The hippocampal theta oscillation is strongly correlated with behaviors such as memory and spatial navigation, but we do not understand its specific functional role. One hint of theta's function came from the discovery in rodents that theta oscillations are traveling waves that allow parts of the hippocampus to simultaneously exhibit separate oscillatory phases. Because hippocampal theta oscillations in humans have different properties compared with rodents, we examined these signals directly using multielectrode recordings from neurosurgical patients. Our findings confirm that human hippocampal theta oscillations are traveling waves, but also show that these oscillations appear at a broader range of frequencies compared with rodents. Human traveling waves showed a distinctive pattern of spatial propagation such that there is a consistent phase spread across the hippocampus regardless of the oscillations' frequency. This suggests that traveling theta oscillations are important functionally in humans because they coordinate phase coding throughout the hippocampus in a consistent manner.
{SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT} We show for the first time in humans that hippocampal theta oscillations are traveling waves, moving along the length of the hippocampus in a posterior–anterior direction. The existence of these traveling theta waves is important for understanding hippocampal neural coding because they cause neurons at separate positions in the hippocampus to experience different theta phases simultaneously. The theta phase that a neuron measures is a key factor in how that cell represents behavioral information. Therefore, the existence of traveling theta waves indicates that, to fully understand how a hippocampal neuron represents information, it is vital to also account for that cell's location in addition to conventional measures of neural activity.},

	abstract = {Theta (6–12 Hz) field potentials and the synchronization (coherence) of these potentials present neural network indices of hippocampal physiology. Theta signals within the hippocampal formation may reflect alterations in sensorimotor integration, the flow of sensory input, and/or distinct cognitive operations. While the power and coherence of theta signals vary across lamina within the septal hippocampus, limited information is available about variation in these indices across the septotemporal (long) or areal axis. The present study examined the relationship of locomotor speed to theta indices at {CA}1 and dentate gyrus ({DG}) sites across the septotemporal axis as well as in the entorhinal cortex. Our findings demonstrate the dominant relationship of speed to theta indices at septal sites. This relationship diminished systematically with distance from the septal pole of the hippocampus at both {CA}1 and {DG} sites. While theta power at entorhinal sites varied in relation to speed, there were no differences across the areal axis of the entorhinal cortex. Locomotor speed was also related to changes in theta coherence along the septotemporal axis as well as between the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. In addition to the speed-related variation, we observed a decrease in theta power at more temporal hippocampal sites over repeated behavioral testing within a single day that was not observed at septal sites. The results outline a dynamic and distributed pattern of network activity across the septotemporal axis of the hippocampus in relation to locomotor speed and recent past experience.},

	abstract = {A topographical relationship exists between the septotemporal segments of the hippocampus and their entorhinal–neocortical targets, but the physiological organization of activity along the septotemporal axis is poorly understood. We recorded sharp-wave ripple patterns in rats during sleep from the entire septotemporal axis of the {CA}1 pyramidal layer. Qualitatively similar ripples emerged at all levels. From the local seed, ripples traveled septally or temporally at a speed of ∼0.35 m/s, and the spatial spread depended on ripple magnitude. Ripples propagated smoothly across the septal and intermediate segments of the hippocampus, but ripples in the temporal segment often remained isolated. These findings show that ripples can combine information from the septal and intermediate hippocampus and transfer integrated signals downstream. In contrast, ripples that emerged in the temporal pole broadcast largely independent information to their cortical and subcortical targets.},

This modulation is thought to be important not only for temporal encoding and decoding of information in the hippocampal system, but also for temporal ordering of neuronal activities on timescales at which physiological mechanisms of synaptic plasticity operate. The medial entorhinal cortex ({MEC}), one of the two major cortical inputs to the hippocampus, is known to show theta modulation. Here, we show that the local field potentials ({LFPs}) in the other major cortical input to the hippocampus, the lateral entorhinal cortex ({LEC}), show weaker theta oscillations than those shown in the {MEC}. Neurons in {LEC} also show weaker theta modulation than that of neurons in {MEC}. These findings suggest that {LEC} inputs are integrated into hippocampal representations in a qualitatively different manner than the {MEC} inputs. Furthermore, {MEC} grid cells increase the scale of their periodic spatial firing patterns along the dorsoventral axis, corresponding to the increasing size of place fields along the septotemporal axis of the hippocampus. We show here a corresponding gradient in the tendency of {MEC} neural firing to skip alternate theta cycles. We propose a simple model based on interference of delta oscillations with theta oscillations to explain this behavior.},

We measured the relationship between moment-by-moment changes in behavior and information flow through hippocampal output area {CA}1 in rats. We examined local field potential ({LFP}) patterns, evoked potentials and ensemble spiking and found evidence suggestive of a smooth transition from strong {CA}3 drive of {CA}1 activity at low speeds to entorhinal cortical drive of {CA}1 activity at higher speeds. These changes occurred with changes in behavior on a timescale of less than a second, suggesting a continuous modulation of information processing in the hippocampal circuit as a function of behavioral state.},

However, the lack of methods for direct and cell-type-specific interference with inhibition has prevented better insights that help link synaptic and cellular properties with network function. Here, we generated genetically modified mice ({PV}-Δγ2) in which synaptic inhibition was ablated in parvalbumin-positive ({PV}+) interneurons. Hippocampal local field potential and unit recordings in the {CA}1 area of freely behaving mice revealed that theta rhythm was strongly reduced in these mice. The characteristic coupling of theta and gamma oscillations was strongly altered in {PV}-Δγ2 mice more than could be accounted for by the reduction in theta rhythm only. Surprisingly, gamma oscillations were not altered. These data indicate that synaptic inhibition onto {PV}+ interneurons is indispensable for theta- and its coupling to gamma oscillations but not for rhythmic gamma-activity in the hippocampus. Similar alterations in rhythmic activity were obtained in a computational hippocampal network model mimicking the genetic modification, suggesting that intrahippocampal networks might contribute to these effects.},

Cortical circuits are thought to multiplex firing rate codes with temporal codes that rely on oscillatory network activity, but the circuit mechanisms that combine these coding schemes are unclear. We establish with optogenetic activation of layer {II} of the medial entorhinal cortex that theta frequency drive to this circuit is sufficient to generate nested gamma frequency oscillations in synaptic activity. These nested gamma oscillations closely resemble activity during spatial exploration, are generated by local feedback inhibition without recurrent excitation, and have clock-like features suitable as reference signals for multiplexing temporal codes within rate-coded grid firing fields. In network models deduced from our data, feedback inhibition supports coexistence of theta-nested gamma oscillations with attractor states that generate grid firing fields. These results indicate that grid cells communicate primarily via inhibitory interneurons. This circuit mechanism enables multiplexing of oscillation-based temporal codes with rate-coded attractor states.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Learning and memory deficits are a source of considerable morbidity after traumatic brain injury ({TBI}). We investigated the effect of different patterns of hippocampal stimulation via a fornix electrode on cognitively demanding tasks after {TBI}.
{METHODS}: Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent fluid-percussion injury and were compared with sham-operated rats. Electrodes were implanted into the fornix and hippocampus, and stimulation of the fornix produced robust evoked potentials in the hippocampus. A 60-s delayed non-match-to-sample ({DNMS}) swim T-maze was serially performed using four stimulation patterns: no stimulation (No Stim), low-frequency stimulation ({LFS}, 5 Hz), high-frequency stimulation ({HFS}, 130 Hz), and theta-burst stimulation ({TBS}, 200 Hz in 50 ms trains, five trains per second; 60 µA biphasic pulses). In a separate cohort of sham and injured animals, Morris water maze ({MWM}) was performed with or without {TBS}.
{RESULTS}: In the {DNMS} swim T-maze, {LFS} and {HFS} did not significantly improve performance after {TBI}. However, there was a significant difference in performance between {TBI} + No Stim and {TBI} + {TBS} groups (P {\textless} 0.05) with no significant difference between Sham + No Stim and {TBI} + {TBS}. In the {MWM}, latency in the {TBI} + {TBS} group was significantly different from {TBI} + No Stim starting on day 2 (P {\textless} 0.05) and was not different from Sham + No Stim. The {TBI} + {TBS} group performed significantly more platform crossings in the probe trial (P {\textless} 0.01) and exhibited improved search strategy starting on day 3 (P {\textless} 0.05) compared with {TBI} + No Stim.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Deficits in learning and memory after {TBI} are improved with {TBS} of the hippocampus. {HFS} and {LFS} do not appear to produce as great an effect as {TBS}.},

	abstract = {Traumatic brain injury ({TBI}) often results in persistent attention and memory deficits that are associated with hippocampal dysfunction. Although deep brain stimulation ({DBS}) is used to treat neurological disorders related to motor dysfunction, the effectiveness of stimulation to treat cognition remains largely unknown. In this study, adult male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a lateral fluid percussion or sham injury followed by implantation of bipolar electrodes in the medial septal nucleus ({MSN}) and ipsilateral hippocampus. In the first week after injury, there was a significant decrease in hippocampal theta oscillations that correlated with decreased object exploration and impaired performance in the Barnes maze spatial learning task. Continuous 7.7 Hz theta stimulation of the medial septum significantly increased hippocampal theta oscillations, restored normal object exploration, and improved spatial learning in injured animals. There were no benefits with 100 Hz gamma stimulation, and stimulation of sham animals at either frequency did not enhance performance. We conclude, therefore, that there was a theta frequency-specific benefit of {DBS} that restored cognitive function in brain-injured rats. These data suggest that septal theta stimulation may be an effective and novel neuromodulatory therapy for treatment of persistent cognitive deficits following {TBI}.},

Oscillatory activity in the hippocampus is critical for normal learning and memory functions, and can be modulated using deep brain stimulation techniques. In this pre-clinical study, we demonstrate that lateral fluid percussion {TBI} results in the attenuation of hippocampal theta oscillations in the first 6 days after injury, which correlate with deficits in the Barnes maze spatial working memory task. Theta band stimulation of the medial septal nucleus ({MSN}) results in a transient increase in hippocampal theta activity, and when delivered 1 min prior to training in the Barnes maze, it significantly improves spatial working memory.

	volume = {57},
	issn = {0306-4522},
	abstract = {Intracellular current clamp recordings were obtained from mossy cells (n = 6, identified by intracellular injection of biocytin) of the dorsal dentate gyrus from rats under ketamine-xylazine anesthesia. During electroencephalographic theta rhythm (4-6 Hz), recorded with a macroelectrode placed in the contralateral dorsal hippocampus near the fissure, mossy cells displayed intracellular membrane potential oscillations at low frequencies (4-6 Hz) which appeared to be phase locked to the electroencephalographic theta rhythm. The frequency of the intracellular theta rhythm was independent of the membrane potential. However, the phase difference between the intracellular and the electroencephalographic theta rhythms as well as the amplitude of the intracellular theta oscillations were voltage-dependent. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that rhythmic {GABAA} receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials contribute to the genesis of the intracellular theta rhythm. Indeed, mossy cells displayed an early, fast inhibitory postsynaptic potential in response to electrical stimulation of the entorhinal cortex, which most likely represents a {GABAA} receptor-mediated event, indicating that mossy cells possess functional {GABAA} receptors. At the resting membrane potential, mossy cells did not fire at each cycle of the electroencephalographic theta rhythm but fired only rarely ({\textless} 1 Hz). However, when they did fire they did so preferentially in phase with the peak positivity of the electroencephalographic theta rhythm. Reconstruction of two mossy cells with axonal projections to the inner molecular layer showed that the spatial extent of the influence such weakly discharging mossy cells may have on other dentate gyrus neurons during theta oscillations can be several millimeters in the septotemporal direction. In conclusion, these findings show that mossy cells of the rat hilus during ketamine-xylazine anesthesia participate in theta oscillations of the hippocampal formation, during which their low-frequency firing may contribute to the phase-locking of a large number of spatially distributed postsynaptic neurons with postsynaptic sites in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}1. Intracellularly recorded low- and high-frequency (4-6 and 25-50 Hz, respectively), rhythmic, spontaneous membrane potential oscillations were investigated in pyramidal neurons of the rat hippocampus in vivo, during theta (theta, 4-6 Hz) electroencephalographic ({EEG}) activity, under ketamine-xylazine anesthesia. 2. The {EEG} activity showed two spectral peaks, one in the theta range, the other at higher frequencies (25-50 Hz). On the basis of their electrophysiological and pharmacological properties, it was concluded that the {EEG} theta-waves, and the fast {EEG} rhythm, recorded during ketamine-xylazine anesthesia, share the basic properties of those theta and fast rhythms that are recorded under the effects of other types of anesthetics. 3. When intracellular recordings (n = 32) were made with electrodes filled with potassium-acetate (K-acetate), the only {CA}1 and {CA}3 pyramidal cells ({PCs}) considered for further analysis were those that did not fire rhythmically at most or each cycle of the theta rhythm at the resting membrane potential. During {EEG}-theta, the membrane potential (Vm) of these cells showed a prominent oscillation (3-15 {mV}) with frequencies similar to those of the {EEG}-theta (the intracellular theta rhythm, intra-theta). 4. The frequency of the intra-theta was independent of the Vm. However, the phase difference between the intra-theta and the {EEG}-theta was voltage dependent in both types of cells. {CA}1 {PCs} showed a large (120-180 degrees, where 360 degrees is the full cycle), gradual shift in the phase difference between the intra-theta and the {EEG}-theta, when the membrane was hyperpolarized to -85 from -65 {mV}. Although {CA}3 {PCs} displayed a larger variability in their phase-voltage relations, a voltage-dependent phase shift (90-180 degrees) could be observed in {CA}3 {PCs} as well. 5. Although the amplitude of the intra-theta in both {CA}1 and {CA}3 {PCs} could display large, sudden, spontaneous changes at a given Vm, the amplitude-Vm plots tended to show a minimum between -70 and -80 {mV}. Spontaneous changes in the amplitude of the intra-theta did not affect the phase difference between the intra- and the {EEG}-theta rhythms. 6. Intracellular injection of {QX}-314 (50-100 {mM}) did not change the phase-Vm or the amplitude-Vm relationships of {CA}1 {PCs}. 7. Intracellular injection of chloride (Cl-) ions greatly reduced the voltage dependency of the phase difference and revealed fast (duration: 20-25 ms), depolarizing potentials (5-20 {mV}), which appeared at high frequencies (25-50 Hz), amplitude modulated at theta-frequencies.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS}){\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We developed a generally applicable tetanus toxin-based method for transgenic mice that permits inducible and reversible inhibition of synaptic transmission and applied it to the trisynaptic pathway while preserving transmission in the monosynaptic pathway. We found that synaptic output from {CA}3 in the trisynaptic pathway is dispensable and the short monosynaptic pathway is sufficient for incremental spatial learning. In contrast, the full trisynaptic pathway containing {CA}3 is required for rapid one-trial contextual learning, for pattern completion-based memory recall, and for spatial tuning of {CA}1 cells.},

	abstract = {The behaviour-contingent rhythmic synchronization of neuronal activity is reported by local field potential oscillations in the theta, gamma and sharp wave-related ripple ({SWR}) frequency ranges. In the hippocampus, pyramidal cell assemblies representing temporal sequences are coordinated by {GABAergic} interneurons selectively innervating specific postsynaptic domains, and discharging phase locked to network oscillations. We compare the cellular network dynamics in the {CA}1 and {CA}3 areas recorded with or without anaesthesia. All parts of pyramidal cells, except the axon initial segment, receive {GABA} from multiple interneuron types, each with distinct firing dynamics. The axon initial segment is exclusively innervated by axo-axonic cells, preferentially firing after the peak of the pyramidal layer theta cycle, when pyramidal cells are least active. Axo-axonic cells are inhibited during {SWRs}, when many pyramidal cells fire synchronously. This dual inverse correlation demonstrates the key inhibitory role of axo-axonic cells. Parvalbumin-expressing basket cells fire phase locked to field gamma activity in both {CA}1 and {CA}3, and also strongly increase firing during {SWRs}, together with dendrite-innervating bistratified cells, phasing pyramidal cell discharge. Subcellular domain-specific {GABAergic} innervation probably developed for the coordination of multiple glutamatergic inputs on different parts of pyramidal cells through the temporally distinct activity of {GABAergic} interneurons, which differentially change their firing during different network states.},

Within the clusters, the firing frequency of action potentials varied between 13 and 57 Hz in a voltage-dependent manner. In addition, small voltage-dependent subthreshold membrane potential oscillations (16–54 Hz) were observed between clusters. Both subthreshold oscillations and clusters were eliminated by tetrodotoxin at 1 μM. These results indicate that non-cholinergic medial septum neurons could convey to the hippocampus not only theta but also higher frequency rhythmicity in the beta-gamma range (20–60 Hz).},

Here we evaluate the effect of basal ganglia {DBS} on cortical function using invasive cortical recordings in Parkinson's disease ({PD}) patients undergoing {DBS} implantation surgery. In the primary motor cortex of {PD} patients, neuronal population spiking is excessively synchronized to the phase of network oscillations. This manifests in brain surface recordings as exaggerated coupling between the phase of the beta rhythm and the amplitude of broadband activity. We show that acute therapeutic {DBS} reversibly reduces phase-amplitude interactions over a similar time course as that of the reduction in parkinsonian motor signs.

The local field potential ({LFP}) reflects activity of many neurons in the vicinity of the recording electrode and is therefore useful for studying local network dynamics. Much of the nature of the {LFP} is, however, still unknown. There are, for instance, contradicting reports on the spatial extent of the region generating the {LFP}. Here, we use a detailed biophysical modeling approach to investigate the size of the contributing region by simulating the {LFP} from a large number of neurons around the electrode. We find that the size of the generating region depends on the neuron morphology, the synapse distribution, and the correlation in synaptic activity. For uncorrelated activity, the {LFP} represents cells in a small region (within a radius of a few hundred micrometers). If the {LFP} contributions from different cells are correlated, the size of the generating region is determined by the spatial extent of the correlated activity.},

	abstract = {Williams, John H. and Julie A. Kauer. Properties of carbachol-induced oscillatory activity in rat hippocampus. J. Neurophysiol. 78: 2631–2640, 1997. The recent resurgence of interest in carbachol oscillations as an in vitro model of theta rhythm in the hippocampus prompted us to evaluate the circuit mechanisms involved. In extracellular recordings, a regularly spaced bursting pattern of field potentials was observed in both {CA}3 and {CA}1 subfields in the presence of carbachol. Removal of the {CA}3 region abolished oscillatory activity observed in {CA}1, suggesting that the oscillatory generator is located in {CA}3. An α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid ({AMPA}) receptor antagonist, 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione ({DNQX}), blocked carbachol oscillations, indicating that {AMPA} receptor-mediated synaptic currents are necessary for the population oscillation. Moreover, the spread of oscillatory activity into {CA}1 required intact N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. These data are more consistent with epileptiform bursting than with theta rhythm described in vivo. In the presence of carbachol, individual {CA}3 pyramidal cells exhibited a slow, rhythmic intrinsic oscillation that was not blocked by {DNQX} and that was enhanced by membrane hyperpolarization. We hypothesize that this slower oscillation is the fundamental oscillator that participates in triggering the population oscillation by exciting multiple synaptically connected {CA}3 neurons. γ-aminobutyric acid-A ({GABAA}) receptors are not necessary for carbachol to elicit synchronous {CA}3 field events but are essential to the bursting pattern observed. Neither {GABAB} nor metabotropic glutamate receptors appear to be necessary for carbachol oscillations. However, both nicotinic and M1 and M3 muscarinic cholinergic receptors contribute to the generation of this activity. These results establish the local circuit elements and neurotransmitter receptors that contribute to carbachol-induced oscillations and indicate that carbachol-induced oscillations are fundamentally distinct from theta rhythm in vivo.},

Alterations in theta dynamics may reflect variations in sensorimotor integration, the flow of sensory input, and/or cognitive processing. Previously we have investigated septotemporal variation in the locomotor speed to theta amplitude relationship as well as how that relationship is systematically altered as a function of novel, physical space. In the present study, we ask, beyond physical space, whether persistent and passive sound delivery can alter septal theta local field potential rhythm dynamics. Results indicate pronounced alterations in the slope of the speed to theta amplitude relationship as a function of sound presentation and location. Further, this reduction in slope habituates across days. The current findings highlight that moment-to-moment alterations in theta amplitude is a rich dynamic index that is quantitatively related to both alterations in motor behavior and sensory experience. The implications of these phenomena are discussed with respect to emergent cognitive functions subserved by hippocampal circuits.},

	abstract = {We present a new model for the generation of theta rhythm of the hippocampus. We propose that theta at {CA}1 involves extracellular current fluxes produced by alternating depolarizing and hyperpolarizing membrane potential fluctuations of large populations of hippocampal pyramidal cells. Pyramidal cells are, in turn, controlled by rhythmically bursting cholinergic and {GABAergic} cells of the medial septum/vertical limb of the diagonal band. We postulate that septal cholinergic and {GABAergic} rhythmically bursting cells fire in relative synchrony; their coordinated burst discharge (burst mode) drives the positive-going phase of intracellular theta and associated firing of pyramidal cells; their synchronized pauses (interburst mode) give rise to the negative-going phase of intracellular theta and an inhibition of pyramidal cells. We further demonstrate that the theta rhythm is controlled by a network of cells extending from the brainstem to the septum/hippocampus. During theta, tonically discharging cells of the nucleus reticularis pontis oralis activate neurons of the supramammillary nucleus; the supramammillary nucleus, in turn, converts this steady barrage into a rhythmical pattern of discharge which is relayed to {GABAergic}/ cholinergic rhythmically bursting cells of the medial septum. The septal rhythmically bursting cells modulate subsets of hippocampal interneurons and principal cells in the generation of the theta rhythm. We review evidence showing that the serotonin-containing neurons of the median raphe nucleus desynchronize the hippocampal electroencephalogram, presumably by disrupting the rhythmical discharge of septal cholinergic and {GABAergic} neurons. Finally, we summarize recent work indicating that the theta rhythm is critically involved in memory functions of the hippocampus and that its disruption (electroencephalographic desynchronization) may block or temporarily suspend mnemonic processes of the hippocampus.},

Active conductances in dendrites may facilitate interneuron activation, but direct experimental evidence was unavailable. Patch-clamp recordings from dendrites of hippocampal oriens-alveus interneurons revealed high densities of voltage-gated sodium and potassium ion channels. Simultaneous recordings from dendrites and somata suggested that action potential initiation occurs preferentially in the axon with long threshold stimuli, but can be shifted to somatodendritic sites when brief stimuli are applied. After initiation, action potentials propagate over the somatodendritic domain with constant amplitude, high velocity, and reliability, even during high-frequency trains.},

	abstract = {Experimental and theoretical studies demonstrate that neuronal gamma oscillations crucially depend on interneurons, but current models do not consider the diversity of known interneuron subtypes. Moreover, in {CA}1 of the hippocampus, experimental evidence indicates the presence of multiple gamma oscillators, two of which may be coordinated by differing interneuron populations. In this article, we show that models of networks with competing interneuron populations with different postsynaptic effects are sufficient to generate, within {CA}1, distinct oscillatory regimes. We find that strong mutual inhibition between the interneuron populations permits distinct fast and slow gamma states, whereas weak mutual inhibition generates mixed gamma states. We develop idealized firing rate models to illuminate dynamic properties of these competitive gamma networks, and reinforce these concepts with basic spiking models. The models make several explicit predictions about gamma oscillators in {CA}1. Specifically, interneurons of different subtype phase-lock to different gamma states, and one population of interneurons is silenced and the other active during fast and slow gamma events. Finally, mutual inhibition between interneuron populations is necessary to generate distinct gamma states. Previous experimental studies indicate that fast and slow gamma oscillations reflect different information processing modes, although it is unclear whether these rhythms are intrinsic or imposed. The models outlined demonstrate that basic architectures can locally generate these oscillations, as well as capture other features of fast and slow gamma, including theta-phase preference and spontaneous transitions between gamma states. These models may extend to describe general dynamics in networks with diverse interneuron populations.
{NEW} \& {NOTEWORTHY} The oscillatory coordination of neural signals is crucial to healthy brain function. We have developed an idealized neuronal model that generates distinct fast and slow gamma oscillations, a known feature of the rodent hippocampus. Our work provides a mechanism of this phenomenon, as well as a theoretical framework for future experiments concerning hippocampal gamma. It moreover offers a tractable model of competitive gamma oscillations that is generalizable across the nervous system.},

	abstract = {Cortical and hippocampal gamma oscillations have been implicated in many behavioral tasks. The hippocampus is required for spatial navigation where animals run at varying speeds. Hence we tested the hypothesis that the gamma rhythm could encode the running speed of mice. We found that the amplitude of slow (20-45 Hz) and fast (45-120 Hz) gamma rhythms in the hippocampal local field potential ({LFP}) increased with running speed. The speed-dependence of gamma amplitude was restricted to a narrow range of theta phases where gamma amplitude was maximal, called the preferred theta phase of gamma. The preferred phase of slow gamma precessed to lower values with increasing running speed. While maximal fast and slow gamma occurred at coincident phases of theta at low speeds, they became progressively more theta-phase separated with increasing speed. These results demonstrate a novel influence of speed on the amplitude and timing of the hippocampal gamma rhythm which could contribute to learning of temporal sequences and navigation.},

	abstract = {Gamma frequency oscillations (30–100 Hz) have been suggested to underlie various cognitive and motor functions. Here, we examine the generation of gamma oscillation currents in the hippocampus, using two-dimensional, 96-site silicon probes. Two gamma generators were identified, one in the dentate gyrus and another in the {CA}3-{CA}1 regions. The coupling strength between the two oscillators varied during both theta and nontheta states. Both pyramidal cells and interneurons were phase-locked to gamma waves. Anatomical connectivity, rather than physical distance, determined the coupling strength of the oscillating neurons. {CA}3 pyramidal neurons discharged {CA}3 and {CA}1 interneurons at latencies indicative of monosynaptic connections. Intrahippocampal gamma oscillation emerges in the {CA}3 recurrent system, which entrains the {CA}1 region via its interneurons.},

	volume = {70},
	issn = {0022-3077},
	abstract = {1. Intracellularly recorded low- and high-frequency (4-6 and 25-50 Hz, respectively), rhythmic, spontaneous membrane potential oscillations were investigated in pyramidal neurons of the rat hippocampus in vivo, during theta (theta, 4-6 Hz) electroencephalographic ({EEG}) activity, under ketamine-xylazine anesthesia. 2. The {EEG} activity showed two spectral peaks, one in the theta range, the other at higher frequencies (25-50 Hz). On the basis of their electrophysiological and pharmacological properties, it was concluded that the {EEG} theta-waves, and the fast {EEG} rhythm, recorded during ketamine-xylazine anesthesia, share the basic properties of those theta and fast rhythms that are recorded under the effects of other types of anesthetics. 3. When intracellular recordings (n = 32) were made with electrodes filled with potassium-acetate (K-acetate), the only {CA}1 and {CA}3 pyramidal cells ({PCs}) considered for further analysis were those that did not fire rhythmically at most or each cycle of the theta rhythm at the resting membrane potential. During {EEG}-theta, the membrane potential (Vm) of these cells showed a prominent oscillation (3-15 {mV}) with frequencies similar to those of the {EEG}-theta (the intracellular theta rhythm, intra-theta). 4. The frequency of the intra-theta was independent of the Vm. However, the phase difference between the intra-theta and the {EEG}-theta was voltage dependent in both types of cells. {CA}1 {PCs} showed a large (120-180 degrees, where 360 degrees is the full cycle), gradual shift in the phase difference between the intra-theta and the {EEG}-theta, when the membrane was hyperpolarized to -85 from -65 {mV}. Although {CA}3 {PCs} displayed a larger variability in their phase-voltage relations, a voltage-dependent phase shift (90-180 degrees) could be observed in {CA}3 {PCs} as well. 5. Although the amplitude of the intra-theta in both {CA}1 and {CA}3 {PCs} could display large, sudden, spontaneous changes at a given Vm, the amplitude-Vm plots tended to show a minimum between -70 and -80 {mV}. Spontaneous changes in the amplitude of the intra-theta did not affect the phase difference between the intra- and the {EEG}-theta rhythms. 6. Intracellular injection of {QX}-314 (50-100 {mM}) did not change the phase-Vm or the amplitude-Vm relationships of {CA}1 {PCs}. 7. Intracellular injection of chloride (Cl-) ions greatly reduced the voltage dependency of the phase difference and revealed fast (duration: 20-25 ms), depolarizing potentials (5-20 {mV}), which appeared at high frequencies (25-50 Hz), amplitude modulated at theta-frequencies.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

According to the efficient market hypothesis, stock prices should follow a random walk pattern and thus should not be predictable with more than about 50 percent accuracy. In this paper, we investigated the predictability of the Dow Jones Industrial Average index to show that not all periods are equally random. We used the Hurst exponent to select a period with great predictability. Parameters for generating training patterns were determined heuristically by auto-mutual information and false nearest neighbor methods. Some inductive machine-learning classifiers—artificial neural network, decision tree, and k-nearest neighbor were then trained with these generated patterns. Through appropriate collaboration of these models, we achieved prediction accuracy up to 65 percent.},

	abstract = {There is great interest in the role of coherent oscillations in the brain. In some cases, high-frequency oscillations ({HFOs}) are integral to normal brain function, whereas at other times they are implicated as markers of epileptic tissue. Mechanisms underlying {HFO} generation, especially in abnormal tissue, are not well understood. Using a physiological computer model of hippocampus, we investigate random synaptic activity (noise) as a potential initiator of {HFOs}. We explore parameters necessary to produce these oscillations and quantify the response using the tools of stochastic resonance ({SR}) and coherence resonance ({CR}). As predicted by {SR}, when noise was added to the network the model was able to detect a subthreshold periodic signal. Addition of basket cell interneurons produced two novel {SR} effects: 1) improved signal detection at low noise levels and 2) formation of coherent oscillations at high noise that were entrained to harmonics of the signal frequency. The periodic signal was then removed to study oscillations generated only by noise. The combined effects of network coupling and synaptic noise produced coherent, periodic oscillations within the network, an example of {CR}. Our results show that, under normal coupling conditions, synaptic noise was able to produce gamma (30–100 Hz) frequency oscillations. Synaptic noise generated {HFOs} in the ripple range (100–200 Hz) when the network had parameters similar to pathological findings in epilepsy: increased gap junctions or recurrent synaptic connections, loss of inhibitory interneurons such as basket cells, and increased synaptic noise. The model parameters that generated these effects are comparable with published experimental data. We propose that increased synaptic noise and physiological coupling mechanisms are sufficient to generate gamma oscillations and that pathologic changes in noise and coupling similar to those in epilepsy can produce abnormal ripples.},

It is a clinical diagnosis that can be made only when other disease processes are excluded. The etiology of chronic fatigue syndrome is unclear, is likely complex, and may involve dysfunction of the immune or adrenal systems, an association with certain genetic markers, or a history of childhood trauma. Persons with chronic fatigue syndrome should be evaluated for concurrent depression, pain, and sleep disturbances. Treatment options include cognitive behavior therapy and graded exercise therapy, both of which have been shown to moderately improve fatigue levels, work and social adjustment, anxiety, and postexertional malaise.

In the current edition, we decided to focus on describing those interventions with the best evidence of effectiveness, in widespread clinical use or with recent trial data.

{CBT} may also be beneficial when administered by therapists with no specific experience of chronic fatigue syndrome, but who are adequately supervised.In adolescents, {CBT} can reduce fatigue severity and improve school attendance compared with no treatment.

In a placebo-controlled double-blind crossover study, methylphenidate over 4 weeks was superior to placebo in the relief of fatigue and concentration disturbance. This observational study describes the effect of long-term methylphenidate intake on fatigue, concentration, and daily life activities, as reported by the patients themselves.
{METHODS}: A questionnaire was sent to all {CFS} patients who were prescribed methylphenidate at the general internal medicine department of a university hospital between August 2004 and February 2007, for possible improvement of concentration difficulties and fatigue.
{RESULTS}: Out of 194 consecutive patients, 149 (76.8\%) sent the questionnaire back. At the time of the questionnaire, 65.3\% had stopped the intake of methylphenidate, 34.7\% still took it daily or occasionally. Among the patients who continued methylphenidate, 48\% reported an at least 50\% improvement of fatigue, and 62\% reported an at least 50\% improvement of concentration difficulties. This continued intake of methylphenidate resulted in more working hours in these patients. Side effects (agitation, palpitations, and dry mouth) were reported significantly more in patients who had stopped methylphenidate than in those who still took it.
{CONCLUSION}: The long-term intake of methylphenidate by {CFS} patients with concentration difficulties has a positive effect in about one out of three patients.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The causes of chronic fatigue syndrome ({CFS}) and idiopathic chronic fatigue ({ICF}) are not clearly known, and there are no definitive treatments for them. Therefore, patients with {CFS} and {ICF} are interested in Oriental medicine or complementary and alternative medicine. For this reason, the effectiveness of complementary and alternative treatments should be verified. We investigated the effectiveness of two forms of acupuncture added to usual care for {CFS} and {ICF} compared to usual care alone.
{METHODS}: A three-arm parallel, non-blinded, randomized controlled trial was performed in four hospitals. We divided 150 participants into treatment and control groups at the same ratio. The treatment groups (Group A, body acupuncture; Group B, Sa-am acupuncture) received 10 sessions for 4 weeks. The control group (Group C) continued usual care alone. The primary outcome was the Fatigue Severity Scale ({FSS}) at 5 weeks after randomization. Secondary outcomes were the {FSS} at 13 weeks and a short form of the Stress Response Inventory ({SRI}), the Beck Depression Inventory ({BDI}), the Numeric Rating Scale ({NRS}), and the {EuroQol}-5 Dimension ({EQ}-5D) at 5 and 13 weeks.
{RESULTS}: Group A showed significantly lower {FSS} scores than Group C at 5 weeks (P = 0.023). {SRI} scores were significantly lower in the treatment groups than in the control group at 5 (Group A, P = 0.032; B, P {\textless}0.001) and 13 weeks (Group A, P = 0.037; B, P {\textless}0.001). Group B showed significantly lower {BDI} scores than Group C at 13 weeks (P = 0.007). {NRS} scores from the treatment groups were significantly reduced compared to control at 5 (Group A and B, P {\textless}0.001) and 13 weeks (Group A, P = 0.011; B, P = 0.002).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Body acupuncture for 4 weeks in addition to usual care may help improve fatigue in {CFS} and {ICF} patients.

This review describes some current theories and experimental data concerning the role of sensory input in generating the regular spatial ﬁring patterns of grid cells, and changes in grid cell ﬁring ﬁelds with movement of environmental barriers. As described here, the inﬂuence of visual features on spatial ﬁring could involve either computations of self-motion based on optic ﬂow, or computations of absolute position based on the angle and distance of static visual cues. Due to anatomical selectivity of retinotopic processing, the sensory features on the walls of an environment may have a stronger effect on ventral grid cells that have wider spaced ﬁring ﬁelds, whereas the sensory features on the ground plane may inﬂuence the ﬁring of dorsal grid cells with narrower spacing between ﬁring ﬁelds. These sensory inﬂuences could contribute to the potential functional role of grid cells in guiding goal-directed navigation.},

	abstract = {We study the phenomenon of stochastic resonance on Newman–Watts small-world networks consisting of biophysically realistic Hodgkin–Huxley neurons with a tunable intensity of intrinsic noise via voltagegated ion channels embedded in neuronal membranes. Importantly thereby, the subthreshold periodic driving is introduced to a single neuron of the network, thus acting as a pacemaker trying to impose its rhythm on the whole ensemble. We show that there exists an optimal intensity of intrinsic ion channel noise by which the outreach of the pacemaker extends optimally across the whole network. This stochastic resonance phenomenon can be further ampliﬁed via ﬁne-tuning of the small-world network structure, and depends signiﬁcantly also on the coupling strength among neurons and the driving frequency of the pacemaker. In particular, we demonstrate that the noise-induced transmission of weak localized rhythmic activity peaks when the pacemaker frequency matches the intrinsic frequency of subthreshold oscillations. The implications of our ﬁndings for weak signal detection and information propagation across neural networks are discussed.},

	abstract = {Summary
To explore the link between bioenergetics and motor neuron degeneration, we used a computational model in which detailed morphology and ion conductance are paired with intracellular {ATP} production and consumption. We found that reduced {ATP} availability increases the metabolic cost of a single action potential and disrupts K+/Na+ homeostasis, resulting in a chronic depolarization. The magnitude of the {ATP} shortage at which this ionic instability occurs depends on the morphology and intrinsic conductance characteristic of the neuron. If {ATP} shortage is confined to the distal part of the axon, the ensuing local ionic instability eventually spreads to the whole neuron and involves fasciculation-like spiking events. A shortage of {ATP} also causes a rise in intracellular calcium. Our modeling work supports the notion that mitochondrial dysfunction can account for salient features of the paralytic disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, including motor neuron hyperexcitability, fasciculation, and differential vulnerability of motor neuron subpopulations.},

A network of adenylate kinase isoforms ({AK}1-{AK}7) are distributed throughout intracellular compartments, interstitial space and body fluids to regulate energetic and metabolic signaling circuits, securing efficient cell energy economy, signal communication and stress response. The dynamics of adenylate kinase-catalyzed phosphotransfer regulates multiple intracellular and extracellular energy-dependent and nucleotide signaling processes, including excitation-contraction coupling, hormone secretion, cell and ciliary motility, nuclear transport, energetics of cell cycle, {DNA} synthesis and repair, and developmental programming. Metabolomic analyses indicate that cellular, interstitial and blood {AMP} levels are potential metabolic signals associated with vital functions including body energy sensing, sleep, hibernation and food intake. Either low or excess {AMP} signaling has been linked to human disease such as diabetes, obesity and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Recent studies indicate that derangements in adenylate kinase-mediated energetic signaling due to mutations in {AK}1, {AK}2 or {AK}7 isoforms are associated with hemolytic anemia, reticular dysgenesis and ciliary dyskinesia. Moreover, hormonal, food and antidiabetic drug actions are frequently coupled to alterations of cellular {AMP} levels and associated signaling.

Excitotoxicity is caused by excess levels of glutamate and over-activation of {NMDA} or calcium-permeable {AMPA} receptors on neuronal membranes, leading to ionic influx, energetic stress and potential neuronal death. The metabolic response of neurons to excitotoxicity is complex and plays a key role in the ability of the neuron to adapt and recover from such an insult. Single-cell imaging is a powerful experimental technique that can be used to study the neuronal metabolic response to excitotoxicity in vitro and, increasingly, in vivo. Here, we review some of the knowledge of the neuronal metabolic response to excitotoxicity gained from in vitro single-cell imaging, including calcium and {ATP} dynamics and their effects on mitochondrial function, along with the contribution of glucose metabolism, oxidative stress and additional neuroprotective signalling mechanisms. Future work will combine knowledge gained from single-cell imaging with data from biochemical and computational techniques to garner holistic information about the metabolic response to excitotoxicity at the whole brain level and transfer this knowledge to a clinical setting.},

Being a substrate of the E3 ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex-Cdh1 ({APCCdh}1), {PFKFB}3 is targeted to proteasomal degradation in neurons. Here, we show that activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptors ({NMDAR}) stabilized {PFKFB}3 protein in cortical neurons. Expressed {PFKFB}3 was found to be mainly localized in the nucleus, where it is subjected to degradation; however, expression of {PFKFB}3 lacking the {APCCdh}1-targeting {KEN} motif, or following {NMDAR} stimulation, promoted accumulation of {PFKFB}3 and its release from the nucleus to the cytosol through an excess Cdh1-inhibitable process. {NMDAR}-mediated increase in {PFKFB}3 yielded neurons having a higher glycolysis and lower pentose-phosphate pathway ({PPP}); this led to oxidative stress and apoptotic neuronal death that was counteracted by overexpressing glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the {PPP}. Furthermore, expression of the mutant form of {PFKFB}3 lacking the {KEN} motif was sufficient to trigger oxidative stress and apoptotic death of neurons. These results reveal that, by inhibition of {APCCdh}1, glutamate receptors activation stabilizes {PFKFB}3 thus switching neuronal metabolism leading to oxidative damage and neurodegeneration.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Ap4A and Ap5A on the rate of epileptiform activity. Hippocampal slices (450μm), when perfused with a medium containing no added magnesium and 4-aminopyridine (50{μM}), generate epileptiform activity of an interictal nature. Ap4A and Ap5A at 1{μM} depressed the discharge rate to a significant extent. At this concentration adenosine (1{μM}) did not produce any effect. However at 10{μM} adenosine, Ap4A and Ap5A all decreased the burst frequency. Adenosine deaminase (0.2U/ml) totally annulled the inhibition of epileptiform activity produced by 10{μM} adenosine or 1{μM} Ap4A and Ap5A. Adenosine deaminase did not significantly change the maximum depression of activity produced by 10{μM} Ap4A and Ap5A. 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dimethylxanthine, an A1, receptor antagonist, increased the basal rate of epileptiform activity and prevented the depression of burst discharges by Ap4A. 5′-adenylic acid deaminase converts {AMP} into {IMP} which is inactive. 5′-adenylic acid deaminase did not prevent the inhibitory effects of Ap4A. The results suggests that in the {CA}3 region of the hippocampus, Ap4A and Ap5A act partly by stimulating xanthine-sensitive receptors directly and partly through the formation of the metabolite, adenosine.},

We have now explored the generation of reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) in hippocampal and cortical neurons in culture in response to oxygen and glucose deprivation or metabolic inhibition and reoxygenation. Fluorescence microscopy was used to measure the rate of {ROS} generation using hydroethidine, dicarboxyfluorescein diacetate, or {MitoSOX}. {ROS} generation was correlated with changing mitochondrial potential (rhodamine 123), [Ca2+]c (fluo-4, fura-2, or Indo-1), or {ATP} consumption, indicated by increased [Mg2+]c. We found that three distinct mechanisms contribute to neuronal injury by generating {ROS} and oxidative stress, each operating at a different stage of ischemia and reperfusion. In response to hypoxia, mitochondria generate an initial burst of {ROS}, which is curtailed once mitochondria depolarize or prevented by previous depolarization with uncoupler. A second phase of {ROS} generation that followed after a delay was blocked by the xanthine oxidase ({XO}) inhibitor oxypurinol. This phase correlated with a rise in [Mg2+]c, suggesting {XO} activation by accumulating products of {ATP} consumption. A third phase of {ROS} generation appeared at reoxygenation. This was blocked by {NADPH} oxidase inhibitors and was absent in cells from gp91phox−/− knock-out mice. It was Ca2+ dependent, suggesting activation by increased [Ca2+]c during anoxia, itself partly attributable to glutamate release. Inhibition of either the {NADPH} oxidase or {XO} was significantly neuroprotective. Thus, oxidative stress contributes to cell death over and above the injury attributable to energy deprivation.},

	abstract = {Background
Chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis ({CFS}/{ME}) is characterised by unexplained fatigue for at least 6 months accompanied by a diverse but consistent set of symptoms. Diet modification and nutritional supplements could be used to improve patient outcomes, such fatigue and quality of life. We reviewed and discussed the evidence for nutritional interventions that may assist in alleviating symptoms of {CFS}/{ME}.

Methods
Medline, Cinahl and Scopus were systematically searched from 1994 to May 2016. All studies on nutrition intervention were included where {CFS}/{ME} patients modified their diet or supplemented their habitual diet on patient‐centred outcomes (fatigue, quality of life, physical activity and/or psychological wellbeing).

Results
Seventeen studies were included that meet the inclusion criteria. Of these, 14 different interventions were investigated on study outcomes. Many studies did not show therapeutic benefit on {CFS}/{ME}. Improvements in fatigue were observed for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydride ({NADH}), probiotics, high cocoa polyphenol rich chocolate, and a combination of {NADH} and coenzyme Q10.

Conclusions
This review identified insufficient evidence for the use of nutritional supplements and elimination or modified diets to relieve {CFS}/{ME} symptoms. Studies were limited by the number of studies investigating the interventions, small sample sizes, study duration, variety of instruments used, and studies not reporting dietary intake method. Further research is warranted in homogeneous {CFS}/{ME} populations.},

In this study, we assessed the impact of oral administration of B. infantis 35624, for 6‒8 weeks on inflammatory biomarker and plasma cytokine levels in patients with ulcerative colitis ({UC}) (n = 22), chronic fatigue syndrome ({CFS}) (n = 48) and psoriasis (n = 26) in three separate randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled interventions. Additionally, the effect of B. infantis 35624 on immunological biomarkers in healthy subjects (n = 22) was assessed. At baseline, both gastrointestinal ({UC}) and non-gastrointestinal ({CFS} and psoriasis) patients had significantly increased plasma levels of C-reactive protein ({CRP}) and the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor α ({TNF}-α) and interleukin-6 ({IL}-6) compared with healthy volunteers. B. infantis 35624 feeding resulted in reduced plasma {CRP} levels in all three inflammatory disorders compared with placebo. Interestingly, plasma {TNF}-α was reduced in {CFS} and psoriasis while {IL}-6 was reduced in {UC} and {CFS}. Furthermore, in healthy subjects, {LPS}-stimulated {TNF}-α and {IL}-6 secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells ({PBMCs}) was significantly reduced in the B. infantis 35624-treated groups compared with placebo following eight weeks of feeding. These results demonstrate the ability of this microbe to reduce systemic pro-inflammatory biomarkers in both gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal conditions. In conclusion, these data show that the immunomodulatory effects of the microbiota in humans are not limited to the mucosal immune system but extend to the systemic immune system.},

Probiotic lactic acid producing bacteria have been shown to prevent and alleviate gastrointestinal disturbances and to normalize the cytokine profile which might be of an advantage for patients suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei F19, Lactobacillus acidophilus {NCFB} 1748 and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 on fatigue and physical activity in {CFS} patients. Fifteen patients fulfilling the criteria set by international researchers in the field at the {US} Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in 1994 for chronic fatigue syndrome, were included in the study. The patients had high fatigue severity scores and high disability scores. During the first two weeks baseline observations without treatment were assessed, succeeded by four weeks of intake of a probiotic product and a four-week follow-up period. The fatigue, health and physical activity was assessed by the use of the Visual Analogue Scales and the {SF}-12 Health Survey. Faecal samples were collected and the normal microflora was analysed. Neurocognitive functions improved during the study period while there were no significant changes in fatigue and physical activity scores. No major changes occurred in the gastrointestinal microflora. At the end of the study 6 of 15 patients reported that they had improved according to the assessment described. The findings in this study that improvement of health is possible to achieve should encourage further studies with interventions with probiotics in patients with {CFS}.},

Preclinical evaluation in rodents suggests that certain psychobiotics possess antidepressant or anxiolytic activity.

So far, psychobiotics have been most extensively studied in a liaison psychiatric setting in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, where positive benefits have been reported for a number of organisms including Bifidobacterium infantis. Evidence is emerging of benefits in alleviating symptoms of depression and in chronic fatigue syndrome.

Implications of brain-gut communication in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders indicate a possible role of suitably packaged/delivered probiotics as newer therapeutic options. In the present study probable role of per-oral administration of free Lactobacillus acidophilus ({LAB}) and {LAB} loaded alginate beads in attenuation of the symptoms associated with chronic fatigue syndrome ({CFS}) were evaluated.
{METHODS}: Chronic fatigue syndrome following physical fatigue was induced in rats by forcing them to swim (forced swim test; {FST}) in water till exhaustion, after weighing them down with 10\% their body weight, daily for 28 days. Immobility (I) and postswim fatigue time ({PSF}) were taken as suitable markers. Free {LAB} and {LAB} loaded floating beads ({FBs}) were administered, from 21 to 28 days.
{KEY} {RESULTS}: Immobility and {PSF} were found to increase considerably in {FST} rats (665 ± 22 s and 196 ± 6 s) as compared with the naïve (32 ± 7 s and 22 ± 2 s) at 20 days, establishing severe fatigue like behavior. {FST} control group exhibited significant (P {\textless} 0.05) hypertrophy of spleen, hypotrophy of thymus, and increased oxido-nitrosative stress in brain and tumor necrosis factor-α ({TNF}-α) levels in serum. Treatment with {LAB} and {LAB} {FBs} significantly decreased I and {PSF} and attenuated (P {\textless} 0.05) oxido-nitrosative stress and {TNF}-α levels. Spleen and thymus were also restored to their original size in this group.
{CONCLUSIONS} \& {INFERENCES}: The findings suggest a valuable therapeutic role of {LAB} especially when incorporated into alginate beads for the treatment of {CFS}.},

To this end, the {ATP}-sensor {AT}1.03, which binds to {ATP} and therefore enhances the efficiency of resonance energy transfer between blue fluorescent protein (energy donor) and yellow-green fluorescent protein (energy acceptor), was expressed in cultured hippocampal neurons isolated from 1–2-day-old rat pups. Excitation of fluorescence in the acceptor protein allowed monitoring changes in {pHc}. Cells were loaded with fluorescent low-affinity Ca2+ indicators Fura-{FF} or X-rhod-{FF} to register [Ca2+]i. It was shown that Glu (20 μM, glycine 10 μM, Mg2+-free) produced a rapid acidification of the cytosol and decrease in [{ATP}]c. An approximately linear relationship (r 2 = 0.56) between the rate of [{ATP}]c decline and latency of glutamate-induced delayed calcium deregulation ({DCD}) was observed: higher rate of [{ATP}]c decrease corresponded to shorter {DCD} latency period. {DCD} began with a decrease in [{ATP}]c of as much as 15.9\%. In the phase of high [Ca2+]i, the plateau of [{ATP}]c dropped to 10.4\% compared to [{ATP}]c in resting neurons (100\%). In the presence of the Na+/K+-{ATPase} inhibitor ouabain (0.5 {mM}), glutamate-induced reduction in [{ATP}]c in the phase of the high [Ca2+]i plateau was only 36.6\%. Changes in [{ATP}]c, [Ca2+]i, mitochondrial potential, and {pHc} in calcium-free or sodium-free buffers, as well as in the presence of the inhibitor of Na+/K+-{ATPase} ouabain, led us to suggest that in addition to increase in proton conductivity and decline in [{ATP}]c, one of the triggering factors of {DCD} might be a reversion of the neuronal plasma membrane Na+/Ca2+ exchange.},

	abstract = {Functional neuroimaging has undergone spectacular developments in recent years. Paradoxically, its neurobiological bases have remained elusive, resulting in an intense debate around the cellular mechanisms taking place upon activation that could contribute to the signals measured. Taking advantage of a modeling approach, we propose here a coherent neurobiological framework that not only explains several in vitro and in vivo observations but also provides a physiological basis to interpret imaging signals. First, based on a model of compartmentalized energy metabolism, we show that complex kinetics of {NADH} changes observed in vitro can be accounted for by distinct metabolic responses in two cell populations reminiscent of neurons and astrocytes. Second, extended application of the model to an in vivo situation allowed us to reproduce the evolution of intraparenchymal oxygen levels upon activation as measured experimentally without substantially altering the initial parameter values. Finally, applying the same model to functional neuroimaging in humans, we were able to determine that the early negative component of the blood oxygenation level-dependent response recorded with functional {MRI}, known as the initial dip, critically depends on the oxidative response of neurons, whereas the late aspects of the signal correspond to a combination of responses from cell types with two distinct metabolic profiles that could be neurons and astrocytes. In summary, our results, obtained with such a modeling approach, support the concept that both neuronal and glial metabolic responses form essential components of neuroimaging signals.},

In many types of cancers this leads, even in the presence of oxygen, to the secretion of carbon equivalents (usually in the form of lactate) in the cell’s surroundings, a feature known as the Warburg effect. While the molecular basis of this phenomenon are still to be elucidated, it is clear that the spilling of energy resources contributes to creating a peculiar microenvironment for tumors, possibly characterized by a degree of toxicity. This suggests that mechanisms for recycling the fermentation products (e.g. a lactate shuttle) may be active, effectively inducing a mutually beneficial metabolic coupling between aberrant and non-aberrant cells. Here we analyze this scenario through a large-scale in silico metabolic model of interacting human cells. By going beyond the cell-autonomous description, we show that elementary physico-chemical constraints indeed favor the establishment of such a coupling under very broad conditions. The characterization we obtained by tuning the aberrant cell’s demand for {ATP}, amino-acids and fatty acids and/or the imbalance in nutrient partitioning provides quantitative support to the idea that synergistic multi-cell effects play a central role in cancer sustainment.},

The model describes the tricarboxylic acid ({TCA}) cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial Ca2+ handling. The kinetic component of the model includes effectors of the {TCA} cycle enzymes regulating production of {NADH} and {FADH}2, which in turn are used by the electron transport chain to establish a proton motive force (ΔμH), driving the F1F0-{ATPase}. In addition, mitochondrial matrix Ca2+, determined by Ca2+ uniporter and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger activities, regulates activity of the {TCA} cycle enzymes isocitrate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. The model is described by twelve ordinary differential equations for the time rate of change of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and matrix concentrations of Ca2+, {NADH}, {ADP}, and {TCA} cycle intermediates. The model is used to predict the response of mitochondria to changes in substrate delivery, metabolic inhibition, the rate of adenine nucleotide exchange, and Ca2+. The model is able to reproduce, qualitatively and semiquantitatively, experimental data concerning mitochondrial bioenergetics, Ca2+ dynamics, and respiratory control. Significant increases in oxygen consumption ({VO}2), proton efflux, {NADH}, and {ATP} synthesis, in response to an increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+, are obtained when the Ca2+-sensitive dehydrogenases are the main rate-controlling steps of respiratory flux. These responses diminished when control is shifted downstream (e.g., the respiratory chain or adenine nucleotide translocator). The time-dependent behavior of the model, under conditions simulating an increase in workload, closely reproduces experimentally observed mitochondrial {NADH} dynamics in heart trabeculae subjected to changes in pacing frequency. The steady-state and time-dependent behavior of the model support the hypothesis that mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ plays an important role in matching energy supply with demand in cardiac myocytes.},

	abstract = {Background
Neuro-glial interactions are important for normal functioning of the brain as well as brain energy metabolism. There are two major working models - in the classical view, both neurons and astrocytes can utilize glucose as the energy source through oxidative metabolism, whereas in the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis ({ANLSH}) it is the astrocyte which can consume glucose through anaerobic glycolysis to pyruvate and then to lactate, and this lactate is secreted to the extracellular space to be taken up by the neuron for further oxidative degradation.

Results
In this computational study, we have included hypoxia-induced genetic regulation of these enzymes and transporters, and analyzed whether the {ANLSH} model can provide an advantage to either cell type in terms of supplying the energy demand. We have based this module on our own experimental analysis of hypoxia-dependent regulation of transcription of key metabolic enzymes. Using this experimentation-supported in silico modeling, we show that under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions in a given time period {ANLSH} model does indeed provide the neuron with more {ATP} than in the classical view.

Conclusions
Although the {ANLSH} is energetically more favorable for the neuron, it is not the case for the astrocyte in the long term. Considering the fact that astrocytes are more resilient to hypoxia, we would propose that there is likely a switch between the two models, based on the energy demand of the neuron, so as to maintain the survival of the neuron under hypoxic or glucose-and-oxygen-deprived conditions.},

	abstract = {Most of the adenosine triphosphate ({ATP}) synthesized during glucose metabolism is produced in the mitochondria through oxidative phosphorylation. This is a complex reaction powered by the proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane, which is generated by mitochondrial respiration. A detailed model of this reaction, which includes dynamic equations for the key mitochondrial variables, was developed earlier by Magnus and Keizer. However, this model is extraordinarily complicated. We develop a simpler model that captures the behavior of the original model but is easier to use and to understand. We then use it to investigate the mitochondrial responses to glycolytic and calcium input. We use the model to explain experimental observations of the opposite effects of raising cytosolic Ca2þ in low and high glucose, and to predict the effects of a mutation in the mitochondrial enzyme nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (Nnt) in pancreatic b-cells.},

	abstract = {Brain activity involves essential functional and metabolic interactions between neurons and astrocytes. The importance of astrocytic functions to neuronal signaling is supported by many experiments reporting high rates of energy consumption and oxidative metabolism in these glial cells. In the brain, almost all energy is consumed by the Na+/K+ {ATPase}, which hydrolyzes 1 {ATP} to move 3 Na+ outside and 2 K+ inside the cells. Astrocytes are commonly thought to be primarily involved in transmitter glutamate cycling, a mechanism that however only accounts for few \% of brain energy utilization. In order to examine the participation of astrocytic energy metabolism in brain ion homeostasis, here we attempted to devise a simple stoichiometric relation linking glutamatergic neurotransmission to Na+ and K+ ionic currents. To this end, we took into account ion pumps and voltage/ligand-gated channels using the stoichiometry derived from available energy budget for neocortical signaling and incorporated this stoichiometric relation into a computational metabolic model of neuron-astrocyte interactions. We aimed at reproducing the experimental observations about rates of metabolic pathways obtained by 13C-{NMR} spectroscopy in rodent brain. When simulated data matched experiments as well as biophysical calculations, the stoichiometry for voltage/ligand-gated Na+ and K+ fluxes generated by neuronal activity was close to a 1:1 relationship, and specifically 63/58 Na+/K+ ions per glutamate released. We found that astrocytes are stimulated by the extracellular K+ exiting neurons in excess of the 3/2 Na+/K+ ratio underlying Na+/K+ {ATPase}-catalyzed reaction. Analysis of correlations between neuronal and astrocytic processes indicated that astrocytic K+ uptake, but not astrocytic Na+-coupled glutamate uptake, is instrumental for the establishment of neuron-astrocytic metabolic partnership. Our results emphasize the importance of K+ in stimulating the activation of astrocytes, which is relevant to the understanding of brain activity and energy metabolism at the cellular level.},

The model describes how the trade-offs arise from individual parameters, including the interplay of feedback control with autocatalysis of network products necessary to power and catalyze intermediate reactions. We then use control theory to prove that the essential features of these hard trade-off “laws” are universal and fundamental, in that they depend minimally on the details of this system and generalize to the robust efficiency of any autocatalytic network. The theory also suggests worst-case conditions that are consistent with initial experiments.

	abstract = {Most cancer cells exhibit an accelerated glycolysis rate compared to normal cells. This metabolic change is associated with the over-expression of all the pathway enzymes and transporters (as induced by {HIF}-1α and other oncogenes), and with the expression of hexokinase ({HK}) and phosphofructokinase type 1 ({PFK}-1) isoenzymes with different regulatory properties. Hence, a control distribution of tumor glycolysis, modified from that observed in normal cells, can be expected. To define the control distribution and to understand the underlying control mechanisms, kinetic models of glycolysis of rodent {AS}-30D hepatoma and human cervix {HeLa} cells were constructed with experimental data obtained here for each pathway step (enzyme kinetics; steady-state pathway metabolite concentrations and fluxes). The models predicted with high accuracy the fluxes and metabolite concentrations found in living cancer cells under physiological O2 and glucose concentrations as well as under hypoxic and hypoglycemic conditions prevailing during tumor progression. The results indicated that {HK}≥{HPI}{\textgreater}{GLUT} in {AS}-30D whereas glycogen degradation≥{GLUT}{\textgreater}{HK} in {HeLa} were the main flux- and {ATP} concentration-control steps. Modeling also revealed that, in order to diminish the glycolytic flux or the {ATP} concentration by 50\%, it was required to decrease {GLUT} or {HK} or {HPI} by 76\% ({AS}-30D), and {GLUT} or glycogen degradation by 87–99\% ({HeLa}), or decreasing simultaneously the mentioned steps by 47\%. Thus, these proteins are proposed to be the foremost therapeutic targets because their simultaneous inhibition will have greater antagonistic effects on tumor energy metabolism than inhibition of all other glycolytic, non-controlling, enzymes.

Brain concentration of lactate, the end product of glucose utilization via glycolysis, varies as a function of sleep state, and like slow wave activity ({SWA}) in the electroencephalogram ({EEG}), increases as a function of time spent awake or in rapid eye movement sleep and declines as a function of time spent in slow wave sleep ({SWS}). We sought to determine whether lactate concentration exhibits homeostatic dynamics akin to those of {SWA} in {SWS}. Lactate concentration in the cerebral cortex was measured by indwelling enzymatic biosensors. A set of equations based conceptually on Process S (previously used to quantify the homeostatic dynamics of {SWA}) was used to predict the sleep/wake state-dependent dynamics of lactate concentration in the cerebral cortex. Additionally, we applied an iterative parameter space-restricting algorithm (the Nelder-Mead method) to reduce computational time to find the optimal values of the free parameters. Compared to an exhaustive search, this algorithm reduced the computation time required by orders of magnitude. We show that state-dependent lactate concentration dynamics can be described by a homeostatic model, but that the optimal time constants for describing lactate dynamics are much smaller than those of {SWA}. This disconnect between lactate dynamics and {SWA} dynamics does not support the concept that lactate concentration is a biochemical mediator of sleep homeostasis. However, lactate synthesis in the cerebral cortex may nonetheless be informative with regard to sleep function, since the impact of glycolysis on sleep slow wave regulation is only just now being investigated.},

	abstract = {{NAD}+ catabolism and mitochondrial dynamics are important parts of normal mitochondrial function and are both reported to be disrupted in aging, neurodegenerative diseases, and acute brain injury. While both processes have been extensively studied there has been little reported on how the mechanisms of these two processes are linked. This review focuses on how downstream {NAD}+ catabolism via {NUDIX} hydrolases affects mitochondrial dynamics under pathologic conditions. Additionally, several potential targets in mitochondrial dysfunction and fragmentation are discussed, including the roles of mitochondrial poly({ADP}-ribose) polymerase 1({mtPARP}1), {AMPK}, {AMP}, and intra-mitochondrial {GTP} metabolism. Mitochondrial and cytosolic {NUDIX} hydrolases ({NUDT}9α and {NUDT}9β) can affect mitochondrial and cellular {AMP} levels by hydrolyzing {ADP}- ribose ({ADPr}) and subsequently altering the levels of {GTP} and {ATP}. Poly ({ADP}-ribose) polymerase 1 ({PARP}1) is activated after {DNA} damage, which depletes {NAD}+ pools and results in the {PARylation} of nuclear and mitochondrial proteins. In the mitochondria, {ADP}-ribosyl hydrolase-3 ({ARH}3) hydrolyzes {PAR} to {ADPr}, while {NUDT}9α metabolizes {ADPr} to {AMP}. Elevated {AMP} levels have been reported to reduce mitochondrial {ATP} production by inhibiting the adenine nucleotide translocase ({ANT}), allosterically activating {AMPK} by altering the cellular {AMP}: {ATP} ratio, and by depleting mitochondrial {GTP} pools by being phosphorylated by adenylate kinase 3 ({AK}3), which uses {GTP} as a phosphate donor. Recently, activated {AMPK} was reported to phosphorylate mitochondria fission factor ({MFF}), which increases Drp1 localization to the mitochondria and promotes mitochondrial fission. Moreover, the increased {AK}3 activity could deplete mitochondrial {GTP} pools and possibly inhibit normal activity of {GTP}-dependent fusion enzymes, thus altering mitochondrial dynamics.},

As a result, the proportion of cell pairs coactive during {SWRs} was predictive of subsequent correct or incorrect responses on a trial-by-trial basis. This effect was seen specifically during early learning, when the hippocampus is essential for task performance. {SWR} activity preceding correct trials represented multiple trajectories that included both correct and incorrect options.

The replay of previously stored memories during hippocampal sharp wave ripples ({SWRs}) is thought to support both memory retrieval and consolidation in distributed hippocampal-neocortical circuits. Replay events consist of precisely timed sequences of spikes from {CA}3 and {CA}1 neurons that are coordinated both within and across hemispheres. The mechanism of this coordination is not understood. Here, we show that during {SWRs} in both awake and quiescent states there are transient increases in slow gamma (20-50 Hz) power and synchrony across dorsal {CA}3 and {CA}1 networks of both hemispheres. These gamma oscillations entrain {CA}3 and {CA}1 spiking. Moreover, during awake {SWRs}, higher levels of slow gamma synchrony are predictive of higher quality replay of past experiences. Our results indicate that {CA}3-{CA}1 gamma synchronization is a central component of awake memory replay and suggest that transient gamma synchronization serves as a clocking mechanism to enable coordinated memory reactivation across the hippocampal network.},

Here, we show that stored representations are reactivated during both waking and sleep replay. We found frequent awake replay of sequences of rat hippocampal place cells from a previous experience. This spatially remote replay was as common as local replay of the current environment and was more robust when the rat had recently been in motion than during extended periods of quiescence.

	abstract = {During development, activity-dependent processes increase the specificity of neural responses to stimuli, but the role that this type of process plays in adult plasticity is unclear. We examined the dynamics of hippocampal activity as animals learned about new environments to understand how neural selectivity changes with experience. Hippocampal principal neurons fire when the animal is located in a particular subregion of its environment, and in any given environment the hippocampal representation is sparse: less than half of the neurons in areas {CA}1 and {CA}3 are active whereas the rest are essentially silent. Here we show that different dynamics govern the evolution of this sparsity in {CA}1 and upstream area {CA}3. {CA}1, but not {CA}3, produces twice as many spikes in novel compared with familiar environments. This high rate firing continues during sharp wave ripple events in a subsequent rest period. The overall {CA}1 population rate declines and the number of active cells decreases as the environment becomes familiar and task performance improves, but the decline in rate is not uniform across neurons. Instead, the activity of cells with initial peak spatial rates above ∼12 Hz is enhanced, whereas the activity of cells with lower initial peak rates is suppressed. The result of these changes is that the active {CA}1 population comes to consist of a relatively small group of cells with strong spatial tuning. This process is not evident in {CA}3, indicating that a region-specific and long timescale process operates in {CA}1 to create a sparse, spatially informative population of neurons.},

Relatively little is known about how the network transitions between these different patterns of activity during exploration. Here we show that hippocampal network changes quickly and continuously as animals explore and become familiar with initially novel places. We measured the relationship between moment-bymoment changes in behavior and information flow through hippocampal output area {CA}1 in rats. We examined local field potential ({LFP}) patterns, evoked potentials and ensemble spiking and found evidence suggestive of a smooth transition from strong {CA}3 drive of {CA}1 activity at low speeds to entorhinal cortical drive of {CA}1 activity at higher speeds. These changes occurred with changes in behavior on a timescale of less than a second, suggesting a continuous modulation of information processing in the hippocampal circuit as a function of behavioral state.},

Theta oscillations are believed to play an important role in the coordination of neuronal firing in the entorhinal ({EC})-hippocampal system but the underlying mechanisms are not known. We simultaneously recorded from neurons in multiple regions of the {EC}-hippocampal loop and examined their temporal relationships. Theta-coordinated synchronous spiking of {EC} neuronal populations predicted the timing of current sinks in target layers in the hippocampus. However, the temporal delays between population activities in successive anatomical stages were longer (typically by a half theta cycle) than expected from axon conduction velocities and passive synaptic integration of feed-forward excitatory inputs. We hypothesize that the temporal windows set by the theta cycles allow for local circuit interactions and thus a considerable degree of computational independence in subdivisions of the {EC}-hippocampal loop.},

Changes in the environment alter the firing patterns of hippocampal neurons, but are presumably constrained by elements of the network dynamics. We compared the neural activity in {CA}1 and {CA}3 regions of the hippocampus in rats running for water reward on a linear track, before and after the track length was shortened. A fraction of cells lost their place fields and new sets of cells with fields emerged, indicating distinct representation of the two tracks. Cells active in both environments shifted their place fields in a location-dependent manner, most notably at the beginning and the end of the track. Furthermore, peak firing rates and place-field sizes decreased, whereas place-field overlap and coactivity increased. Power in the theta-frequency band of the local field potentials also decreased in both {CA}1 and {CA}3, along with the coherence between the two structures. In contrast, the theta-scale (0–150 ms) time lags between cell pairs, representing distances on the tracks, were conserved, and the activity of the inhibitory neuron population was maintained across environments. We interpret these observations as reflecting the freedoms and constraints of the hippocampal network dynamics. The freedoms permit the necessary flexibility for the network to distinctly represent unique patterns, whereas the dynamics constrain the speed at which activity propagates between the cell assemblies representing the patterns.},

	abstract = {Mesoscale cortical activity can be defined as the organization of activity of large neuron populations into collective action, forming time-dependent patterns such as traveling waves. Although collective action may play an important role in the cross-scale integration of brain activity and in the emergence of cognitive behavior, a comprehensive formulation of the laws governing its dynamics is still lacking. Because collective action processes are macroscopic with respect to neuronal activity, these processes cannot be described directly with methods and models developed for the microscale (individual neurons). To identify the characteristic features of mesoscopic dynamics, and to lay the foundations for a theoretical description of mesoscopic activity in the hippocampus, we conduct a comprehensive examination of observational data of hippocampal local field potential ({LFP}) recordings. We use the strong correlation between rat running-speed and the {LFP} power to parameterize the energy input into the hippocampus, and show that both the power and nonlinearity of collective action (e.g., theta and gamma rhythms) increase with increased speed. Our results show that collective-action dynamics are stochastic (the precise state of a single neuron is irrelevant), weakly nonlinear, and weakly dissipative. These are the principles of the theory of weak turbulence. Therefore, we propose weak turbulence a theoretical framework for the description of mesoscopic activity in the hippocampus. The weak turbulence framework provides a complete description of the cross-scale energy exchange (the energy cascade). It uncovers the mechanism governing major features of {LFP} spectra and bispectra, such as the physical meaning of the exponent {\textbackslash}alpha of power-law {LFP} spectra (e.g., f{\textasciicircum}\{-{\textbackslash}alpha\}, where f is the frequency), the strengthening of theta-gamma coupling with energy input into the hippocampus, as well as specific phase lags associated with their interaction. Remarkably, the weak turbulence framework is consistent with the theory of self organized criticality, which provides a simple explanation for the existence of the power-law background spectrum. Together with self-organized criticality, weak turbulence could provide a unifying approach to modeling the dynamics of mesoscopic activity.},

Current source density ({CSD}) was computed from the voltage as a function of depth. A problem inherent to {AC}-coupled profiles was eliminated by incorporating sustained potential components of the {EEG}. ‘{AC}’ profiles force phasic current sinks to alternate with current sources at each lamina, changing the magnitude and even the sign of the computed membrane current. It was possible to include {DC} potentials in the profiles from anesthetized rats by using glass micropipettes for recording. A method of ‘subtracting’ profiles of the non-theta {EEG} from theta profiles was developed as an approach to including sustained potentials in recordings from freely-moving animals implanted with platinum electrodes. ‘{DC}’ profiles are superior to ‘{AC}’ profiles for analysis of {EEG} activity because ‘{DC}’-{CSD} values can be considered correct in sign and more closely represent the actual membrane current magnitudes. Since hippocampal inputs are laminated, {CSD} analysis leads to straightforward predictions of the afferents involved. Theta-related activity in afferents from entorhinal neurons, hippocampal interneurons and ipsi- and contralateral hippocampal pyramids all appear to contribute to sources and sinks in {CA}1 and the dentate area. The largest theta-related generator was a sink at the fissure, having both phasic and tonic components. This sink may reflect activity in afferents from the lateral entorhinal cortex. The phase of the dentate mid-molecular sink suggests that medial entorhinal afferents drive the theta-related granule and pyramidal cell firing. The sustained components may be simply due to different average rates of firing during theta rhythm than during non-theta {EEG} in afferents whose firing rates are also phasically modulated.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate socio-demographic and clinical factors influencing the health-related quality of life ({HRQOL}) of adult patients with epilepsy in a naturalistic treatment setting in Russia.
Methods
The {QOLIE}-31 questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory ({BDI}) were completed by 208 patients with a broad clinical spectrum of epilepsy (the mean age was 31.49±13.20years and ranged from 18 to 74years).
Results
In Russian adult patients with epilepsy, lower mean {QOLIE}-31 scores were obtained compared with previously published international data for overall {HRQOL}, emotional well-being, and cognitive functioning and social functioning subscales (p{\textless}0.001). Univariate analysis revealed that duration of epilepsy negatively correlated with all {QOLIE}-31 subscores (p{\textless}0.05), except for emotional well-being (p=0.1). In multivariate regression analysis, {BDI} depression score was the predictor of overall score and all {QOLIE}-31 domains, except for emotional well-being. Age could be considered as a predictor of cognitive and social functioning, medical effects, and the total {QOLIE} -31 score. Seizure frequency was a factor associated with all {HRQOL} domains, except for medication effects and emotional well-being, whereas gender, education, family status, seizure type, employment, lateralization of epileptic foci, number of antiepileptic drugs, and the reported adverse events did not significantly affect {HRQOL}.
Conclusion
The present study has revealed that longer duration of epilepsy, older age, higher seizure frequency, and depression are the potential predictors of worse {HRQOL} in adult Russian patients with epilepsy.},

	abstract = {Objective
The objective of this study was to investigate prospectively the direct costs of epilepsy in Russia, taking a patient perspective and a bottom-up approach.
Methods
The study was conducted in adolescents and adults with epilepsy seen in the ambulatory services of a city hospital in Moscow. Patients were assigned to different prognostic categories: newly diagnosed epilepsy; epilepsy in remission for 2+years; epilepsy in remission for {\textless}2years or with occasional seizures; active, nondrug-resistant epilepsy; drug-resistant epilepsy; and drug-resistant epilepsy in surgical candidates. Patients were followed prospectively for 12months. Demographic and clinical features at admission were collected and correlated with costs. Cost estimates were based on the Russian National Health Service perspective and its implementation in Moscow. Cost items included drugs and laboratory/instrumental tests. The costs per patient were calculated for the entire sample and for each prognostic category separately. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.
Results
Included were 738 patients (393 men, 345 women aged 14–85years). The median annual cost/patient was €955 ({IQR} 521–2134; range 51–10,904). The median cost of drugs was €643 ({IQR} 288–1866; range 0–9960), and the median cost of laboratory/instrumental testing was €202 ({IQR} 160–270; range 20–1217). Mean costs varied across prognostic categories ranging from €782 in newly diagnosed patients to €3777 in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Mean ({SD}) hospital costs ranged from €646.7 (109.0) in patients with occasional seizures to €950.0 (28.3) in surgical candidates. Independent predictors of total costs were younger age at diagnosis, disability status, generalized seizures, multiple seizure types, seizure severity, and etiology.
Significance
The cost of epilepsy in Moscow varies significantly depending on disease characteristics and response to drug treatment.},

	abstract = {Summary
This study is the first analysis of the epidemiology of epilepsy in the Russian Federation ({RF}), in the English medical literature. The {RF} is geographically the largest territory in the world with a population of 142 million. The study evaluated prevalence of epilepsy in older teenagers and adults in 14 regions of the {RF} with total population of 517,624 persons (about 0.34\% of all the population of the {RF}). Study sites were located in both European (Western population) and Siberian (Eastern population) regions of Russia. We identified 1753 patients with established epilepsy (1033 men, 720 women) from available medical information sources. Epilepsy cases were evaluated by study neurologists or epileptologists; all the patients underwent {EEG}, one third – neuroimaging. The age adjusted prevalence of epilepsy, standardized to the European Standard Million was 3.40 (95\%{CI}: 3.26–3.55) per 1000. Prevalence was higher among men—4.50 (95\%{CI}: 4.25–4.76) than among women—2.52 (95\%{CI}: 2.35–2.69) (p{\textless}0.0001). Prevalence in the Eastern population was significantly higher than in the Western population. The highest prevalence was found in the age group 50–59 years. Localization-related (focal) epilepsies/epilepsy syndromes were diagnosed in the majority (81.6\%). In about one-third of those with localization-related epilepsies etiology remained undetermined. Head injury was the main identified cause of epilepsy, followed by cerebrovascular disorders.
Conclusion
The prevalence of epilepsy in the population ≥14 y.o. in Russia is consistent with results of the studies in adults in other European countries, although at lower end of the range. Age and gender trends are similar.},

	abstract = {Cellular activity in the {CA}1 area of the hippocampus waxes and wanes at theta frequency (4-8 Hz) during exploratory behavior of rats. Perisomatic inhibition onto pyramidal cells tends to be strongest out of phase with pyramidal cell activity, whereas dendritic inhibition is strongest in phase with pyramidal cell activity. Synaptic plasticity also varies across the theta cycle, from strong long-term potentiation ({LTP}) to long-term depression ({LTD}), putatively corresponding to encoding and retrieval phases for information patterns encoded by pyramidal cell activity (Hasselmo et al. (2002a) Neural Comput 14:793-817). The mechanisms underpinning the phasic changes in plasticity are not clear, but it is likely that inhibition plays a role by affecting levels of electrical activity and calcium concentration at synapses. We explore the properties of synaptic plasticity during theta at Schaffer collateral synapses on {CA}1 pyramidal neurons and the influence of spatially and temporally targeted inhibition using a detailed multicompartmental model of the {CA}1 pyramidal neuron microcircuit and a phenomenological model of synaptic plasticity. The results suggest {CA}3-{CA}1 synapses are potentiated on one phase of theta due to high calcium levels provided by paired weak {CA}3 and layer {III} entorhinal cortex ({EC}) inputs even when somatic spiking is inhibited by perisomatic interneuron activity. Weak {CA}3 inputs alone induce lower calcium transients and result in depression of the {CA}3-{CA}1 synapses. These synapses are depressed if activated in phase with dendritic inhibition as strong {CA}3 inputs alone are not able to cause high calcium in this theta phase even though the {CA}1 pyramidal neuron shows somatic spiking. Dendritic inhibition acts as a switch that prevents {LTP} and promotes {LTD} during the retrieval phases of the theta rhythm in {CA}1 pyramidal cell. This may be important for not overly reinforcing recalled memories and in forgetting no longer relevant memories.},

To gain insight into the cellular and circuit level mechanisms of theta activity, we implemented a similar form of interference using the actual hippocampal network in mice in vitro. We found that pairing increasing levels of phasic dendritic excitation with phasic stimulation of perisomatic projecting inhibitory interneurons induced a somatic polarization and action potential timing profile that reproduced most common features. Alterations in the temporal profile of inhibition were required to fully capture all features. These data suggest that theta-related place cell activity is generated through an interaction between a phasic dendritic excitation and a phasic perisomatic shunting inhibition delivered by interneurons, a subset of which undergo activity-dependent presynaptic modulation.},

	abstract = {Multi-neuronal recording is a powerful electrophysiological technique that has revealed much of what is known about the neuronal interactions in the brain. However, it is difficult to detect precise spike timings, especially synchronized simultaneous firings, among closely neighboring neurons recorded by one common electrode because spike waveforms overlap on the electrode when two or more neurons fire simultaneously. In addition, the non-Gaussian variability (nonstationarity) of spike waveforms, typically seen in the presence of so-called complex spikes, limits the ability to sort multi-neuronal activities into their single-neuron components. Because of these problems, the ordinary spike-sorting techniques often give inaccurate results. Our previous study has shown that independent component analysis ({ICA}) can solve these problems and separate single-neuron components from multi-neuronal recordings. The {ICA} has, however, one serious limitation that the number of separated neurons must be less than the number of electrodes. The present study combines the {ICA} and the efficiency of the ordinary spike-sorting technique (k-means clustering) to solve the spike-overlapping and the nonstationarity problems with no limitation on the number of single neurons to be separated. First, multi-neuronal activities are sorted into an overly large number of clusters by k-means clustering. Second, the sorted clusters are decomposed by {ICA}. Third, the decomposed clusters are progressively aggregated into a minimal set of putative single neurons based on similarities of basis vectors estimated by {ICA}. We applied the present procedure to multi-neuronal waveforms recorded with tetrodes composed of four microwires in the prefrontal cortex of awake behaving monkeys. The results demonstrate that there are functional connections among neighboring pyramidal neurons, some of which fire in a precise simultaneous manner and that precisely time-locked monosynaptic connections are working between neighboring pyramidal neurons and interneurons. Detection of these phenomena suggests that the present procedure can sort multi-neuronal activities, which include overlapping spikes and realistic non-Gaussian variability of spike waveforms, into their single-neuron components. We processed several types of synthesized data sets in this procedure and confirmed that the procedure was highly reliable and stable. The present method provides insights into the local circuit bases of excitatory and inhibitory interactions among neighboring neurons.},

	abstract = {The muscarinic M1 receptor plays a significant role in cognition, probably by modulating information processing in key regions such as the hippocampus. To understand how the muscarinic M1 receptor achieves these functions in the hippocampus, it is critical to know the distribution of the receptor within this complex brain region. To date, there are limited data on the distribution of muscarinic M1 receptors in the human hippocampus which may also be confounded because some anti-muscarinic receptor antibodies have been shown to lack specificity. Initially, using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry, we showed the anti-muscarinic M1 receptor antibody to be used in our study bound to a single 62kDa protein that was absent in mice lacking the muscarinic M1 receptor gene. Then, using immunohistochemistry, we determined the distribution of muscarinic M1 receptors in human hippocampus from 10 subjects with no discernible history of a neurological or psychiatric disorder. Our data shows the muscarinic M1 receptor to be predominantly on pyramidal cells in the hippocampus. Muscarinic M1 receptor positive cells were most apparent in the deep polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus, the pyramidal cell layer of cornu ammonis region 3, the cellular layers of the subiculum, layer {II} of the presubiculum and layer {III} and V of the parahippocampal gyrus. Positive cells were less numerous and less intensely stained in the pyramidal layer of cornu ammonis region 2 and were sparse in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus as well as cornu ammonis region 1. Although immunoreactivity was present in the granular layer of the dentate gyrus, it was difficult to identity individual immunopositive cells, possibly due to the density of cells. This distribution of the muscarinic M1 receptors in human hippocampus, and its localisation on glutamatergic cells, would suggest the receptor has a significant role in modulating excitatory hippocampal neurotransmission.},

	abstract = {The strength of cortical synapses distributes lognormally, with a long tail of strong synapses. Various properties of neuronal activity, such as the average firing rates of neurons, the rate and magnitude of spike bursts, the magnitude of population synchrony, and the correlations between presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes, also obey lognormal-like distributions reported in the rodent hippocampal {CA}1 and {CA}3 areas. Theoretical models have demonstrated how such a firing rate distribution emerges from neural network dynamics. However, how the other properties also display lognormal patterns remain unknown. Because these features are likely to originate from neural dynamics in {CA}3, we model a recurrent neural network with the weights of recurrent excitatory connections distributed lognormally to explore the underlying mechanisms and their functional implications. Using multi-timescale adaptive threshold neurons, we construct a low-frequency spontaneous firing state of bursty neurons. This state well replicates the observed statistical properties of population synchrony in hippocampal pyramidal cells. Our results show that the lognormal distribution of synaptic weights consistently accounts for the observed long-tailed features of hippocampal activity. Furthermore, our model demonstrates that bursts spread over the lognormal network much more effectively than single spikes, implying an advantage of spike bursts in information transfer. This efficiency in burst propagation is not found in neural network models with Gaussian-weighted recurrent excitatory synapses. Our model proposes a potential network mechanism to generate sharp waves in {CA}3 and associated ripples in {CA}1 because bursts occur in {CA}3 pyramidal neurons most frequently during sharp waves.
{SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT} The wiring structure of local cortical networks is known to be far from random. Here, we propose a recurrent neural network model with a long-tailed synaptic weight distribution to account for various properties of the synchronous firing of hippocampal neurons observed typically during sharp wave ripples. Furthermore, the model predicts that pathways of strong synapses route spike bursts much more efficiently than single spikes. Sharp wave ripples are crucial for memory encoding, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Our model suggests the crucial role of internal dynamics of nonrandom hippocampal circuits in generating and routing such activity patterns. Our results will have significant implications in understanding the mechanism of memory encoding by the hippocampus.},

New methods for optical stimulation and optical recording of neurons make it possible to map circuit connectivity on a very large scale. However, single synapses produce small responses that are difficult to measure on a large scale. Here I analyze how single synaptic responses may be detectable using relatively coarse readouts such as optical recording of somatic calcium. I model a network consisting of 10,000 input axons and 100 {CA}1 pyramidal neurons, each represented using 19 compartments with voltage-gated channels and calcium dynamics. As single synaptic inputs cannot produce a measurable somatic calcium response, I stimulate many inputs as a baseline to elicit somatic action potentials leading to a strong calcium signal. I compare statistics of responses with or without a single axonal input riding on this baseline. Through simulations I show that a single additional input shifts the distribution of the number of output action potentials. Stochastic resonance due to probabilistic synaptic release makes this shift easier to detect. With ∼80 stimulus repetitions this approach can resolve up to 35\% of individual activated synapses even in the presence of 20\% recording noise. While the technique is applicable using conventional electrical stimulation and extracellular recording, optical methods promise much greater scaling, since the number of synapses scales as the product of the number of inputs and outputs. I extrapolate from current high-speed optical stimulation and recording methods, and show that this approach may scale up to the order of a million synapses in a single two-hour slice-recording experiment.},

	abstract = {The information processing abilities of neural circuits arise from their synaptic connection patterns. Understanding the laws governing these connectivity patterns is essential for understanding brain function. The overall distribution of synaptic strengths of local excitatory connections in cortex and hippocampus is long-tailed, exhibiting a small number of synaptic connections of very large efficacy. At the same time, new synaptic connections are constantly being created and individual synaptic connection strengths show substantial fluctuations across time. It remains unclear through what mechanisms these properties of neural circuits arise and how they contribute to learning and memory. In this study we show that fundamental characteristics of excitatory synaptic connections in cortex and hippocampus can be explained as a consequence of self-organization in a recurrent network combining spike-timing-dependent plasticity ({STDP}), structural plasticity and different forms of homeostatic plasticity. In the network, associative synaptic plasticity in the form of {STDP} induces a rich-get-richer dynamics among synapses, while homeostatic mechanisms induce competition. Under distinctly different initial conditions, the ensuing self-organization produces long-tailed synaptic strength distributions matching experimental findings. We show that this self-organization can take place with a purely additive {STDP} mechanism and that multiplicative weight dynamics emerge as a consequence of network interactions. The observed patterns of fluctuation of synaptic strengths, including elimination and generation of synaptic connections and long-term persistence of strong connections, are consistent with the dynamics of dendritic spines found in rat hippocampus. Beyond this, the model predicts an approximately power-law scaling of the lifetimes of newly established synaptic connection strengths during development. Our results suggest that the combined action of multiple forms of neuronal plasticity plays an essential role in the formation and maintenance of cortical circuits.},

Post hoc anatomical characterization revealed that all but one of the identified presynaptic neurons were oriens-lacunosum moleculare (O-{LM}) cells, whereas the postsynaptic neurons were highly heterogeneous, including neurogliaform (n?=?4), basket (n?=?4), Schaffer collateral-associated (n?=?10) and perforant path-associated (n?=?9) cells. We investigated the short-term plasticity expressed at these synapses, and found that stimulation at 10?40?Hz resulted in short-term depression of {uIPSCs}. This short-term plasticity was determined by presynaptic factors and was not target-cell specific. We found that the feedforward inhibition elicited by the direct cortical input including the perforant path onto {CA}1 pyramidal cells was modulated through the inhibitory synapses we have characterized. Our data show that the inhibitory synapses between interneurons of the {SO} and {SLM} shift the balance between feedback and feedforward inhibition onto {CA}1 pyramidal neurons.},

	abstract = {Spike-timing-dependent plasticity ({STDP}) modifies the weight (or strength) of synaptic connections between neurons and is considered to be crucial for generating network structure. It has been observed in physiology that, in addition to spike timing, the weight update also depends on the current value of the weight. The functional implications of this feature are still largely unclear. Additive {STDP} gives rise to strong competition among synapses, but due to the absence of weight dependence, it requires hard boundaries to secure the stability of weight dynamics. Multiplicative {STDP} with linear weight dependence for depression ensures stability, but it lacks sufficiently strong competition required to obtain a clear synaptic specialization. A solution to this stability-versus-function dilemma can be found with an intermediate parametrization between additive and multiplicative {STDP}. Here we propose a novel solution to the dilemma, named log-{STDP}, whose key feature is a sublinear weight dependence for depression. Due to its specific weight dependence, this new model can produce significantly broad weight distributions with no hard upper bound, similar to those recently observed in experiments. Log-{STDP} induces graded competition between synapses, such that synapses receiving stronger input correlations are pushed further in the tail of (very) large weights. Strong weights are functionally important to enhance the neuronal response to synchronous spike volleys. Depending on the input configuration, multiple groups of correlated synaptic inputs exhibit either winner-share-all or winner-take-all behavior. When the configuration of input correlations changes, individual synapses quickly and robustly readapt to represent the new configuration. We also demonstrate the advantages of log-{STDP} for generating a stable structure of strong weights in a recurrently connected network. These properties of log-{STDP} are compared with those of previous models. Through long-tail weight distributions, log-{STDP} achieves both stable dynamics for and robust competition of synapses, which are crucial for spike-based information processing.},

Despite the importance of the discharge frequency in neuronal communication, little is known about the firing-rate patterns of cortical populations. Using large-scale recordings from multiple layers of the entorhinal-hippocampal loop, we found that the firing rates of principal neurons showed a lognormal-like distribution in all brain states. Mean and peak rates within place fields of hippocampal neurons were also strongly skewed. Importantly, firing rates of the same neurons showed reliable correlations in different brain states and testing situations, as well as across familiar and novel environments. The fraction of neurons that participated in population oscillations displayed a lognormal pattern. Such skewed firing rates of individual neurons may be due to a skewed distribution of synaptic weights, which is supported by our observation of a lognormal distribution of the efficacy of spike transfer from principal neurons to interneurons. The persistent skewed distribution of firing rates implies that a preconfigured, highly active minority dominates information transmission in cortical networks.},

A traditional view of neural information processing suggests that neurons compute in a highly parallel and distributed manner, in which the cooperation of many weak synaptic inputs is necessary to activate a single neuron. Recent experiments, however, have shown that not all synapses are weak in cortical circuits, but some synapses are extremely strong (several tens of times larger than the average weight). In fact, the weights of excitatory synapses between cortical excitatory neurons often obey a lognormal distribution with a long tail of strong synapses. Here, we review some of our important and recent works on computation with sparsely distributed synaptic weights and discuss the possible implications of this synaptic principle for neural computation by spiking neurons. We demonstrate that internal noise emerges from long-tailed distributions of synaptic weights to produce stochastic resonance effect in the reverberating synaptic pathways constituted by strong synapses. We show a spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule and other mechanisms that produce such weight distributions. A possible hardware realization of lognormally connected networks is also shown.},

	abstract = {Theta frequency field oscillation reflects synchronized synaptic potentials that entrain the discharge of neuronal populations within the ≈100–200 ms range. The cellular-synaptic generation of theta activity in the hippocampus was investigated by intracellular recordings from the somata and dendrites of {CA}1 pyramidal cells in urethane-anesthetized rats. The recorded neurons were verified by intracellular injection of biocytin. Transition from non-theta to theta state was characterized by a large decrease in the input resistance of the neuron (39\% in the soma), tonic somatic hyperpolarization and dendritic depolarization. The probability of pyramidal cell discharge, as measured in single cells and from a population of extracellularly recorded units, was highest at or slightly after the negative peak of the field theta recorded from the pyramidal layer. In contrast, cyclic depolarizations in dendrites corresponded to the positive phase of the pyramidal layer field theta (i.e. the hyperpolarizing phase of somatic theta). Current-induced depolarization of the dendrite triggered large amplitude slow spikes (putative Ca2+ spikes) which were phase-locked to the positive phase of field theta. In the absence of background theta, strong dendritic depolarization by current injection led to large amplitude, self-sustained oscillation in the theta frequency range. Depolarization of the neuron resulted in a voltage-dependent phase precession of the action potentials. The voltage-dependent phase-precession was replicated by a two-compartment conductance model. Using an active (bursting) dendritic compartment spike phase advancement of action potentials, relative to the somatic theta rhythm, occurred up to 360 degrees. These data indicate that distal dendritic depolarization of the pyramidal cell by the entorhinal input during theta overlaps in time with somatic hyperpolarization. As a result, most pyramidal cells are either silent or discharge with single spikes on the negative portion of local field theta (i.e., when the somatic region is least polarized). However, strong dendritic excitation may overcome perisomatic inhibition and the large depolarizing theta rhythm in the dendrites may induce spike bursts at an earlier phase of the extracellular theta cycle. The magnitude of dendritic depolarization is reflected by the timing of action potentials within the theta cycle. We hypothesize that the competition between the out-of-phase theta oscillation in the soma and dendrite is responsible for the advancement of spike discharges observed in the behaving animal.

Multichannel field potentials and current source-sinks were analyzed in hippocampal {CA}1 of adult male rats under urethane anesthesia. A single burst (five pulses at 200 Hz) stimulation of stratum oriens ({OR}) induced {LTP} of the basal dendritic excitatory sink ({ES}), which was maximal when the burst was delivered at ∼340° and ∼160° of the distal dendritic θ rhythm. Apical dendritic sink evoked by stratum radiatum ({RAD}) stimulation also showed biphasic maxima at ∼30° and ∼210° of the distal dendritic θ rhythm, about 50° phase delay to basal dendritic {LTP}. By contrast, maximal population spike ({PS}) excitability, following single-pulse excitation of the basal or mid-apical dendrites, occurred at a θ phase of ∼140°, and maximal basal dendritic {ES} occurred at ∼20°; γ (30–57 Hz) activity recorded in {CA}1 {RAD} had maximal power at ∼300° of the distal dendritic θ rhythm, different from the phases of maximal {LTP}. {LTP} induced during the rising θ phase was {NMDA} receptor sensitive. It is suggested that the θ phase modulation of {CA}1 {PS} excitability is mainly provided by θ-rhythmic proximal inhibition, while dendritic {LTP} is also modulated by dendritic inhibition and excitation, specific to basal and apical dendrites.

Our data reveal a distinct organization of somatosensory-related extra-hippocampal inputs converging onto dentate gyrus and {CA}1. Abstract? The hippocampus is a pivotal structure for episodic memory function. This ability relies on the possibility of integrating different features of sensory stimuli with the spatio-temporal context in which they occur. While recent studies now suggest that somatosensory information is already processed by the hippocampus, the basic mechanisms still remain unexplored. Here, we used electrical stimulation of the paws, the whisker pad or the medial lemniscus to probe the somatosensory pathway to the hippocampus in the anaesthetized rat, and multisite electrodes, in combination with tetrode and intracellular recordings, to look at the properties of somatosensory hippocampal responses. We found that peripheral and lemniscal stimulation elicited small local field potential responses in the dorsal hippocampus about 35?40 ms post-stimulus. Current source density analysis established the local nature of these responses, revealing associated synaptic sinks that were consistently confined to the molecular layer ({ML}) of the dentate gyrus ({DG}), with less regular activation of the {CA}1 stratum lacunosum moleculare ({SLM}). A delayed (40?45 ms), potentially active, current source that outlasted the {SLM} sink was present in about 50\% cases around the {CA}1 pyramidal cell layer. Somatosensory stimulation resulted in multi-unit firing increases in the majority of {DG} responses (79\%), whereas multi-unit firing suppression was observed in the majority of {CA}1 responses (62\%). Tetrode and intracellular recordings of individual cells confirmed different firing modulation in the {DG} and the {CA}1 region, and verified the active nature of both the early {ML} sink and delayed somatic {CA}1 source. Hippocampal responses to somatosensory stimuli were dependent on fluctuations in the strength and composition of synaptic inputs due to changes of the ongoing local (hippocampal) and distant (cortical) state. We conclude that somatosensory signals reach the hippocampus mainly from layer {II} entorhinal cortex to directly discharge {DG} granule cells, while a different predominantly inhibitory process takes place in {CA}1, further controlling the hippocampal output. Therefore, our data reveal a distinct organization of somatosensory-related extra-hippocampal inputs converging onto {DG} and {CA}1.},

Stimulation of the olfactory bulb, lateral olfactory tract, piriform cortex, amygdala-entorhinal transition, lateral entorhinal cortex, or lateral perforant path ({LPP}) evoked an outer molecular layer sink (inferred distal dendritic excitation) in the dentate gyrus, with progressively decreasing onset latency.

	abstract = {Background
Multielectrode arrays ({MEAs}) have been used to understand electrophysiological network dynamics by recording real-time activity in groups of cells. The extent to which the collection of such data enables hypothesis testing on the level of circuits and networks depends largely on the sophistication of the analyses applied.
New method
We studied the systemic temporal variations of endogenous signaling within an organotypic hippocampal network following theta-burst stimulation ({TBS}) to the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathways. The recovered current source density ({CSD}) information from the raw grid of extracellular potentials by using a Gaussian interpolation method increases spatial resolution and avoids border artifacts by numerical differentials.
Results
We compared total sink and source currents in {DG}, {CA}3, and {CA}1; calculated accumulated correlation coefficients to compare pre- with post-stimulation {CSD} dynamics in each region; and reconstructed functional connectivity maps for regional cross-correlations with respect to temporal {CSD} variations. The functional connectivity maps for potential correlations pre- and post-{TBS} were compared to investigate the neural network as a whole, revealing differences post-{TBS}.
Comparison with existing method(s)
Previous {MEA} work on plasticity in hippocampal evoked potentials has focused on synchronicity across the hippocampus within isolated subregions. Such analyses ignore the complex relationships among diverse components of the hippocampal circuitry, thus failing to capture network-level behaviors integral to understanding hippocampal function.
Conclusions
The proposed method of recovering current source density to examine whole-hippocampal function is sensitive to experimental manipulation and is worth further examination in the context of network-level analyses of neural signaling.},

	abstract = {We implemented a new protocol to study spike timing-dependent plasticity at the basal dendrites of hippocampal {CA}1 area in vivo. Pairs of weak synaptic excitation were delivered at different time intervals from a population spike peak, at a theta frequency of 5 Hz. Pairing of spike at 0–10 ms before, but not at 10–20 ms after, excitation induced basal dendritic long-term potentiation ({LTP}). {LTP} induced only by spike-then-excitation pairing is unexpected but of biological and computational significance., Spike timing-dependent plasticity in the hippocampus has rarely been studied in vivo. Using extracellular potential and current source density analysis in urethane-anesthetized adult rats, we studied synaptic plasticity at the basal dendritic excitatory synapse in {CA}1 after excitation-spike ({ES}) pairing; E was a weak basal dendritic excitation evoked by stratum oriens stimulation, and S was a population spike evoked by stratum radiatum apical dendritic excitation. We hypothesize that positive {ES} pairing—generating synaptic excitation before a spike—results in long-term potentiation ({LTP}) while negative {ES} pairing results in long-term depression ({LTD}). Pairing (50 pairs at 5 Hz) at {ES} intervals of −10 to 0 ms resulted in significant input-specific {LTP} of the basal dendritic excitatory sink, lasting 60–120 min. Pairing at +10- to +20-ms {ES} intervals, or unpaired 5-Hz stimulation, did not induce significant basal dendritic or apical dendritic {LTP} or {LTD}. No basal dendritic {LTD} was found after stimulation of stratum oriens with 200 pairs of high-intensity pulses at 25-ms interval. Pairing-induced {LTP} was abolished by pretreatment with an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, 3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid ({CPP}), which also reduced spike bursting during 5-Hz pairing. Pairing at 0.5 Hz did not induce spike bursts or basal dendritic {LTP}. In conclusion, {ES} pairing at 5 Hz resulted in input-specific basal dendritic {LTP} at {ES} intervals of −10 ms to 0 ms but no {LTD} at {ES} intervals of −20 to +20 ms. Associative {LTP} likely occurred because of theta-rhythmic coincidence of subthreshold excitation with a backpropagated spike burst, which are conditions that can occur naturally in the hippocampus.},

	abstract = {Sharp wave bursts, induced by a cooperative discharge of {CA}3 pyramidal cells, are the most synchronous physiological pattern in the hippocampus. In conjunction with sharp wave bursts, {CA}1 pyramidal cells display a high-frequency (200 Hz) network oscillation (ripple). In the present study extracellular field and unit activity was recorded simultaneously from 16 closely spaces sites in the awake rat and the intracellular activity of {CA}1 pyramidal cells during the network oscillation was studied under anesthesia. Current source density analysis of the high-frequency oscillation revealed circumscribed sinks and sources in the vicinity of the pyramidal layer. Single pyramidal cells discharged at a low frequency but were phase locked to the negative peak of the locally derived field oscillation. Approximately 10\% of the simultaneously recorded pyramidal cells fired during a given oscillatory event. Putative interneurons increased their discharge rates during the field ripples severalfold and often maintained a 200 Hz frequency during the oscillatory event. Under urethane and ketamine anesthesia the frequency of ripples was slower (100–120 Hz) than in the awake rat (180–200 Hz). Halothane anesthesia prevented the occurrence of high-frequency field oscillations in the {CA}1 region. Both the amplitude (1–4 {mV}) and phase of the intracellular ripple, but not its frequency, were voltage dependent. The amplitude of intracellular ripple was smallest between -70 and -80 {mV}. The phase of intracellular oscillation relative to the extracellular ripple reversed when the membrane was hyperpolarized more than -80 {mV}. A histologically verified {CA}1 basket cell increased its firing rate during the network oscillation and discharged at the frequency of the extracellular ripple. These findings indicate that the intracellularly recorded fast oscillatory rhythm is not solely dependent on membrane currents intrinsic to the {CA}1 pyramidal cells but it is a network driven phenomenon dependent upon the participation of inhibitory interneurons. We hypothesize that fast field oscillation (200 Hz) in the {CA}1 region reflects summed {IPSPs} in pyramidal cells as a result of high-frequency barrage of interneurons. The sharp wave associated synchronous discharge of pyramidal cells in the millisecond range can exert a powerful influence on retrohippocampal targets and may facilitate the transfer of transiently stored memory traces from the hippocampus to the entorhinal cortex.},

We use neural network modeling to study the mechanism of theta rhythm emergence in the {CA}1 microcircuitry. Our model of the {CA}1 field includes biophysical representation of major cell types related to the theta rhythm emergence: excitatory pyramidal cells and two types of inhibitory interneurons, {PV}+ basket cells and oriens lacunosum–moleculare ({OLM}) cells. The main inputs to the {CA}1 cells come from the entorhinal cortex via perforant pathway, the {CA}3 field via Schaffer collaterals, and the medial septum via fimbria–fornix. By computer simulations we investigated the influence of each input, intrinsic parameters of neurons, and connections between neurons on phase coupling between the theta rhythm and the firing of pyramidal, {PV}+ basket and {OLM} cells in the {CA}1. We found that the input from the {CA}3 field via Schaffercollaterals plays a major role in the formation of phase relations that have been observed in experiments in vivo. The direct input from the medial septum participates in the formation of proper phase relations, but it is not crucial for the production of the theta rhythm in {CA}1 neural populations.},

	abstract = {To understand how electrical signal processing in cortical pyramidal neurons is executed by ion channels, it is essential to know their subcellular distribution. M-channels (encoded by Kv7.2–Kv7.5/{KCNQ}2–{KCNQ}5 genes) have multiple important functions in neurons, including control of excitability, spike afterpotentials, adaptation, and theta resonance. Nevertheless, the subcellular distribution of these channels has remained elusive. To determine the M-channel distribution within {CA}1 pyramidal neurons, we combined whole-cell patch-clamp recording from the soma and apical dendrite with focal drug application, in rat hippocampal slices. Both a M-channel opener (retigabine [N-(2-amino-4-(4-fluorobenzylamino)-phenyl) carbamic acid ethyl ester]) and a blocker ({XE}991 [10,10-bis(4-pyridinylmethyl)-9(10H)-antracenone]) changed the somatic subthreshold voltage response but had no observable effect on local dendritic responses. Under conditions promoting dendritic Ca2+ spikes, local somatic but not dendritic application of M-channel blockers (linopirdine and {XE}991) enhanced the Ca2+ spikes. Simultaneous dendritic and somatic whole-cell recordings showed that the medium afterhyperpolarization after a burst of spikes underwent strong attenuation along the apical dendrite and was fully blocked by somatic {XE}991 application. Finally, by combining patch-clamp and extracellular recordings with computer simulations, we found that perisomatic M-channels reduce the summation of {EPSPs}. We conclude that functional M-channels appear to be concentrated in the perisomatic region of {CA}1 pyramidal neurons, with no detectable M-channel activity in the distal apical dendrites.},

The cells were found to display a variety of bursting patterns phase-locked to hippocampal theta rhythm to a greater or lesser degree. Among phase-locked cells, no systematic distribution in preferential phase could be found, and these cells were shown to maintain their preferential phase for extended periods. Cells were classified into those which showed signs of a broadening of the repolarization phase of their action potential (‘inflected’: putative cholinergic) and those without (‘non-inflected’: putative {GABAergic}). Non-inflected cells tended to fire rhythmic bursts while inflected cells mostly fired in an irregular fashion, although still significantly phase-locked to hippocampal theta. In neither population did the phase-locked cells show any coherent distribution of their preferential phase. Sixty-five per cent of the rhythmically bursting cells showed a significant correlation between the interburst frequency and the animal’s running speed. Five cells displayed rhythmic activity only when the rat ran in a specific direction.

	abstract = {Traditionally, most of the information processing of neural networks is thought to be carried out by excitatory cells. Likewise, recent evidence for temporal coding comes from the study of the detailed firing patterns of excitatory neurons. In the {CA}1 region of the rat hippocampus, pyramidal cells discharge selectively when the animal is in specific locations in its environment, and exhibit a precise relationship with the ongoing rhythmic activity of the network (phase precession). We demonstrate that during a spatial exploratory behavior on a linear track, inhibitory interneurons also show spatial selectivity and phase precession dynamics. We found that the firing rate of interneurons is modulated reliably up and down around an ongoing baseline activity level for specific locations in the environment, producing robust place-specific increases or decreases in discharge. On some sections of the track, the range of theta phases shifts progressively to earlier parts of the theta cycle as the rat advances, so that a negative correlation between phase and position could be demonstrated. Unlike pyramidal cells, phase and rate were not strongly correlated. We discuss the influence of the intrinsic firing properties of interneurons on a model of phase precession, as well as the influence of the detailed shape of the inhibitory oscillation. These results indicate that spatial selectivity and phase precession in {CA}1 are not properties restricted to pyramidal cells. Rather, they may be a more general expression of a common interaction between the different inputs impinging on both excitatory and inhibitory cells in {CA}1 and the intrinsic characteristics of those cells. Furthermore, they suggest that the role of interneurons may extend beyond a global damping of the network by participating in a finely-tuned local processing with the pyramidal cells. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Persistent neural activity lasting for seconds after transient stimulation has been observed in several brain areas. This activity has been taken to be indicative of the integration of inputs on long time scales. Passive membrane properties render neural time constants to be on the order of milliseconds. Intense synaptic bombardment, characteristic of in vivo states, was previously shown to further reduce the time scale of effective integration. We explored how long-term integration in single cells could be supported by dendritic spikes coupled with the theta oscillation, a prominent brain rhythm often observed during working memory tasks. We used a two-compartmental conductance-based model of a hippocampal pyramidal cell to study the interplay of intrinsic dynamics with periodic inputs in the theta frequency band. We show that periodic dendritic spiking integrates inputs by shifting the phase relative to an external oscillation, since spiking frequency is quasi-linearly modulated by current injection. The time-constant of this integration process is practically infinite for input intensities above a threshold (the integration threshold) and can be still several hundred milliseconds long below the integration threshold. The somatic compartment received theta frequency stimulation in antiphase with the dendritic oscillation. Consequently, dendritic spikes could only elicit somatic action potentials when they were sufficiently phase-shifted and thus coincided with somatic depolarization. Somatic depolarization modulated the frequency but not the phase of firing, endowing the cell with the capability to code for two different variables at the same time. Inputs to the dendrite shifted the phase of dendritic spiking, while somatic input was modulating its firing rate. This mechanism resulted in firing patterns that closely matched experimental data from hippocampal place cells of freely behaving rats. We discuss the plausibility of our proposed mechanism and its potential to account for the firing pattern of cells outside the hippocampus during working memory tasks. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {We investigated successive firing of the stellate cells within a theta cycle, which replicates the phase coding of place information, using a network model of the entorhinal cortex layer {II} with loop connections. Layer {II} of the entorhinal cortex ({ECII}) sends signals to the hippocampus, and the hippocampus sends signals back to layer V of the entorhinal cortex ({ECV}). In addition to this major pathway, projection from {ECV} to {ECII} also exists. It is, therefore, inferred that reverberation activity readily appears if projections from {ECV} to {ECII} are potentiated. The frequency of the reverberation would be in a gamma range because it takes signals 20–30 ms to go around the entorhinal-hippocampal loop circuits. On the other hand, it has been suggested that {ECII} is a theta rhythm generator. If the reverberation activity appears in the entorhinal-hippocampal loop circuits, gamma oscillation would be superimposed on a theta rhythm in {ECII} like a gamma-theta oscillation. This is a reminiscence of the theta phase coding of place information. In this paper, first, a network model of {ECII} will be developed in order to reproduce a theta rhythm. Secondly, we will show that loop connections from one stellate cell to the other one are selectively potentiated by afferent signals to {ECII}. Frequencies of those afferent signals are different, and transmission delay of the loop connections is 20 ms. As a result, stellate cells fire successively within one cycle of the theta rhythm. This resembles gamma-theta oscillation underlying the phase coding. Our model also replicates the phase precession of stellate cell firing within a cycle of subthreshold oscillation (theta rhythm).},

	abstract = {Hippocampal {CA}1 neurons receive multiple rhythmical inputs with relatively independent phases during theta activity. It, however, remains to be determined how these multiple rhythmical inputs affect oscillation properties in membrane potential of the {CA}1 pyramidal cell. In order to investigate oscillation properties in the subthreshold membrane potential, we generated oscillations in the membrane potential of the {CA}1 pyramidal cells in rat hippocampal slices in vitro with a sinusoidal current injection into the pyramidal soma at theta band frequencies (4–7 Hz), and analyzed effect of rhythmically excitatory synaptic inputs. The Schaffer collaterals were stimulated with a cyclic Gaussian stimulation method, whose pulse intervals were distributed at 10 pulses/cycle (5 cycles/s). We found that the cyclic Gaussian stimulations induced membrane potential oscillations and their phase delays from the mean of the pulse distribution were dependent on membrane potential oscillation amplitude. We applied four pairs of cyclic Gaussian stimulations and somatic sinusoidal current stimulations at the same frequency (5 Hz) with varying phase differences (−π/2, 0, π/2, π rad). The paired stimulations induced phase distributions of the oscillation in the membrane potential, which showed a dependency on an increasing membrane potential oscillation amplitude response to cyclic Gaussian stimulation. This membrane potential dynamic was exhibited by the mixture of the membrane potential oscillation-amplitude-dependent phase delay and the linear summation of the two sinusoidal waves. These suggest that phases of the membrane potential oscillation are modulated by excitatory synaptic inputs. This phase-modulation by excitatory synaptic inputs may play a crucial role for memory operation in the hippocampus.},

Here we show that pyramidal neurons in the rodent hippocampus use a gradient of inductance in the form of hyperpolarization-activated cation-nonselective ({HCN}) channels as an active mechanism to counteract location-dependent temporal differences of dendritic inputs at the soma. Using simultaneous multi-site whole-cell recordings complemented by computational modeling, we find that this intrinsic biophysical mechanism produces temporal synchrony of rhythmic inputs in the theta and gamma frequency ranges across wide regions of the dendritic tree. While gamma and theta oscillations are known to synchronize activity across space in neuronal networks, our results identify a new mechanism by which this synchrony extends to activity within single pyramidal neurons with complex dendritic arbors.},

	abstract = {θ (4–12 Hz) and γ (40–90) oscillations are prominent rhythms in the mammalian brain. A striking feature of these rhythms, possibly vital to memory encoding, is their specific coordination in a manner that has been termed ‘nesting’, i.e. the preferred occurrence of bouts of γ activity during specific phases of θ. Both rhythms are shaped by the neuromodulator acetylcholine, but it is unknown to what degree their coordination is influenced by cholinergic neuromodulation. Here, we investigated the effects of a blockade of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors by atropine on θ and γ oscillations, and their interaction, in mouse hippocampus in vivo. Multi-site recordings from area {CA}1 of freely moving mice showed that under control conditions γ activity was amplitude-modulated at θ frequencies. This coordination of θ and γ oscillations, as assessed by cross-correlation of θ with the γ envelope, was prominent in basal and apical dendritic laminae but not in intermediate laminae. It was stronger during active exploration than during awake immobility. Atropine (50 mg/kg intraperitoneal) altered several aspects of the individual and nested rhythms. It rendered θ activity irregular, decreased θ oscillation frequency and reduced γ power. Atropine also reduced the amplitude-modulation of γ oscillations at θ frequencies, in part by perturbing the coordination of the rhythms on a short time scale. Thus, our findings demonstrate that phase locking of the amplitude of γ oscillations to θ in hippocampal area {CA}1 is partially governed by neuronal elements harbouring muscarinic receptors.},

The present report presents a compartment model of a {CA}1 pyramidal cell that explains the increase in amplitude and the phase precession of intracellular theta oscillations, with the assumption that the cell receives an asymmetric ramp depolarization ({\textless}10 {mV}) in the place field and rhythmic inhibitory and/or excitatory synaptic driving. Intracellular subthreshold membrane potential oscillations ({MPOs}) increase in amplitude and frequency, and show phase precession within the place field. Theta phase precession and {MPO} power and frequency increase in the place field are caused by a shift in excitatory–inhibitory response, intrinsic theta-frequency resonance, and intrinsic oscillations that depend on voltage-dependent persistent Na+ and slowly inactivating K+ currents, but not on Ih. Phase precession is diminished when theta-frequency resonance is decreased. Simulated spikes fire near the peak of {MPOs} and precess similarly as the {MPOs}. The phase of the {MPOs}/spikes codes for distance in a one-dimensional place field, and phase precession is only weakly dependent on firing rate, running speed, or the duration needed to cross the place field. In addition, phase precession within the place field resumes quickly after disruption by maximal afferent pulse stimulation.},

Activity of parvalbumin-positive hippocampal interneurons is critical for network synchronization but the receptors involved therein have remained largely unknown. Here we report network and behavioral deficits in mice with selective ablation of {NMDA} receptors in parvalbumin-positive interneurons ({NR}1PVCre−/−). Recordings of local field potentials and unitary neuronal activity in the hippocampal {CA}1 area revealed altered theta oscillations (5-10 Hz) in freely behaving {NR}1PVCre−/− mice. Moreover, in contrast to controls, in {NR}1PVCre−/− mice the remaining theta rhythm was abolished by the administration of atropine. Gamma oscillations (35-85 Hz) were increased and less modulated by the concurrent theta rhythm in the mutant. Positional firing of pyramidal cells in {NR}1PVCre−/− mice was less spatially and temporally precise. Finally, {NR}1PVCre−/− mice exhibited impaired spatial working as well as spatial short- and long-term recognition memory but showed no deficits in open field exploratory activity and spatial reference learning.},

A total of 47 neurons were recorded in the septal complex ({MS}, 19; {LS}, 28). The majority of neurons with activity correlated with hippocampal {EEG} were found in the {MS} (14/19). All of the neurons with place-related activity (an increase in unit activity when the rat was in a specific location in the open field) were found in the {LS} (n = 15).

Although much progress has been made in understanding type {II} theta rhythm generation under urethane anesthesia, less is known about the mechanisms underlying type I theta generation during active exploration. To better understand the contributions of cholinergic and {NMDA} receptor activation to type I theta generation, we recorded hippocampal theta oscillations from freely moving mice with local infusion of cholinergic or {NMDA} receptor antagonists to either the hippocampus or the entorhinal cortex ({EC}). We found that cholinergic receptors in the hippocampus, but not the {EC}, and {NMDA} receptors in the {EC}, but not the hippocampus, are critical for open-field theta generation and Y-maze performance. We further found that muscarinic M1 receptors located on pyramidal neurons, but not interneurons, are critical for cholinergic modulation of hippocampal synapses, theta generation, and Y-maze performance. These results suggest that hippocampus and {EC} neurons recruit cholinergic-dependent and {NMDA}-receptor-dependent mechanisms, respectively, to generate theta oscillations to support behavioral performance.},

We used linear microelectrode arrays in epileptics to define the circuits generating theta in inferotemporal, perirhinal, entorhinal, prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices. In all locations, theta was generated by excitatory current sinks in middle layers which receive predominantly feedforward inputs, alternating with sinks in superficial layers which receive mainly feedback/associative inputs. Baseline and event-related theta were generated by indistinguishable laminar profiles of transmembrane currents and unit-firing. Word presentation could reset theta phase, permitting theta to contribute to late event-related potentials, even when theta power decreases relative to baseline. Limited recordings during sentence reading are consistent with rhythmic theta activity entrained by a given word modulating the neural background for the following word. These findings show that theta occurs spontaneously, and can be momentarily suppressed, reset and synchronized by words. Theta represents an alternation between feedforward/divergent and associative/convergent processing modes that may temporally organize sustained processing and optimize the timing of memory formation. We suggest that words are initially encoded via a ventral feedforward stream which is lexicosemantic in the anteroventral temporal lobe; its arrival may trigger a widespread theta rhythm which integrates the word within a larger context.},

It was recently shown using a Chrna2-cre mice line that {OLM} interneurons can modulate entorhinal ({EC}) and {CA}3 inputs and may therefore have an important role in gating, encoding and recall of memory. In this study, we have used a combination of electrophysiology and optogenetics using Chrna2-cre mice to determine the role of Chrna2 interneurons in the subiculum area, the main output region of the hippocampus. We aimed to assess the similarities between Chrna2 subiculum and {CA}1 neurons in terms of the expression of interneuron markers, their membrane properties and their inhibitory input to pyramidal neurons. We found that subiculum and {CA}1 dorsal Chrna2 cells similarly expressed the marker somatostatin (Som) and had comparable membrane and firing properties. The somas of Chrna2 cells in both regions were found in the deepest layer with axons projecting superficially. However, subiculum Chrna2 cells displayed more extensive projections with dendrites which occupied a significantly larger area than in {CA}1. The post-synaptic responses elicited by Chrna2 cells in pyramidal cells of both regions revealed comparable inhibitory responses elicited by {GABAA} receptors and, interestingly, {GABAB} receptor mediated components. This study provides the first in-depth characterization of Chrna2 cells in the subiculum, and suggests that subiculum and {CA}1 Chrna2 cells are generally similar and may play comparable roles in both sub-regions.},

The challenge is to understand the underlying mechanisms. Pioneering discoveries of spatial selectivity in this circuit, i.e. place cells and grid cells, provided a major step forward in tackling this challenge. Considerable research has also shown that sequence learning relies on synaptic plasticity, especially the Hebbian or the {NMDAR}-dependent synaptic plasticity. This raises several questions: Are spatial maps plastic? If so, what is the contribution of Hebbian plasticity to spatial map plasticity? How does the spatial map plasticity contribute to sequence learning? A combination of computational and experimental studies has shown that {NMDAR}-mediated plasticity and theta rhythm can have specific effects on the formation and experiential modification of spatial maps to facilitate predictive coding. Advances in transgenic techniques have provided further support for these mechanisms. Although many exciting challenges remain, these findings have brought us closer to solving the puzzle of how the hippocampal system contributes to spatial memory, and point to a way forward. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The expression of hippocampal theta depends on the proportion of the {MS}-{DB} cells involved in the rhythmic process, and its frequency in the whole theta-range, is determined by the corresponding frequencies of theta-burst in the {MS}-{DB}. The neurons of the {MS}-{DB} have the properties of endogenous rhythmic burst and regular single spike oscillators. Input signals ascending to the {MS}-{DB} from the pontomesencephalic reticular formation increase both the frequency of the {MS}-{DB} theta-bursts and the proportion of neurons involved in theta-activity; serotonergic midbrain raphe nuclei have the opposite effect on the {MS}-{DB} rhythmic activity and hippocampal {EEG} theta. Increase of endogenous acetylcholine (by physostigmine) also increases the proportion of the {MS}-{DB} neurons discharging in theta-bursts (both in intact and basally-undercut septum), but does not influence the theta-frequency. The primary effect of the {MS}-{DB} on hippocampal neurons (pyramidal and non-pyramidal) consists in {GABAergic} reset inhibition. Reset inhibition, after which theta-modulation follows in constant phase relation, is triggered also by sensory stimuli. About two-thirds of the hippocampal pyramidal neurons are tonically inhibited by sensory stimuli which evoke {EEG} theta, while others are excited, or do not change their activity. Anticholinergic drugs restrict the population of rhythmic neurons but do not completely suppress theta-bursts in the {MS}-{DB} and hippocampus. Under their action, {EEG} theta can be evoked (presumably through {GABAergic} {MD}-{DB} influences) by strong reticular or sensory stimuli with corresponding high frequency. However information processing in this condition is defective: expression of reset is increased, responses to electrical stimulation of the perforant path and to sensory stimuli are often augmented, habituation to sensory stimuli is absent and tonic responses are curtailed. On a background of continuous theta induced by increase of endogenous acetylcholine, reset is absent or reduced, responsiveness of the hippocampal neurons to electrical and sensory stimulation is strongly reduced. It is suggested that the theta-rhythm has a double function in information processing: it facilitates and prolongs the action of the stimuli entering the hippocampus in phase with concomitantly triggered theta (‘filtering in’), and it prevents the admission of signals appearing during on-going theta triggered by a previous event (“filtering out”), eliminating interference during processing and registration of information. Thus, the theta-rhythm may be regarded as a mechanism of selective attention, a prerequisite for memory trace formation.},

	abstract = {Abstract Processing of multimodal sensory information by the morphological subdivisions of the hippocampus and its input and output structures was investigated in unanesthetized rabbits by extracellular recording of neuronal activity. Analysis shows principal differences between {CA}3 neurons with uniform multimodal, mainly inhibitory, rapidly habituating sensory responses, and {CA}1-subicular neurons, substantial parts of which have phasic reactions and patterned on-responses, depending on the characteristics of the stimuli. These differences result from the organization of the afferent inputs to {CA}1 and {CA}3. Analysis of neuronal responses in sources of hippocampal inputs, their electrical stimulation, and chronic disconnection show the greater functional significance of the brain-stem reticular input for tonic responses characteristic of {CA}3. This input signal before entering the hippocampus is additionally preprocessed at the {MS}-{DB} relay, where it becomes more uniform and frequency-modulated in the range of theta-rhythm. It is shown that the new sensory stimuli produce inhibitory reset, after which synchronized theta-modulation is triggered. Other stimuli, appearing at the background of the ongoing theta, do not evoke any responses of the hippocampal neurons. Thus, theta-modulation can be regarded as a mechanism of attention, which prolongs response to a selected stimulus and simultaneously protects its processing against interference. The cortical input of the hippocampus introduces highly differentiated information analyzed at the highest levels of the neocortex through the intermediary of the entorhinal cortex and presubiculum. However, only {CA}1-subiculum receives this information directly; before its entrance into {CA}3, it is additionally preprocessed at the {FD} relay, where the secondary simplification of signals occurs. As a result, {CA}3 receives by its two inputs ({MS}-{DB} and {FD}) messages just about the presence and level of input signals in each of them, and performs relatively simple functions of determination of match/mismatch of their weights. For this comparator system, the presence of signal only in the reticulo-septal input is equivalent to quality of novelty. The cortical signal appears with some delay, after its analysis in the neocortex and shaping in the prehippocampal structures; besides, it is gradually increased due to {LTP}-like incremental changes in {PP} and mossy fiber synapses. The {CA}3 neurons with potentiated synapses of cortical input do not respond to sensory stimuli; that is, the increased efficacy of the cortical signals can be regarded as ?familiarity? of a signal, terminating the reactive state of the {CA}3 neurons. The integrity of both inputs is necessary for gradual habituation of sensory responses in the hippocampus. The output signals of {CA}3 following in the precommissural fornix to the output relay-{LS} nucleus and to the brain-stem structures have strong regulatory influence on the level of brain activity (arousal), which is an important condition for processing and registration of information. The primary targets of this output signal are raphe nuclei, which suppress activity of the ascending excitatory {RF}. In the background state, activity of the {CA}3 neurons through the intermediary of raphe keeps {RF} under tonic inhibitory control. Inhibition of the majority of {CA}3 pyramidal neurons during a novel stimulus action decreases the volume of its output signal to raphe and releases {RF} from tonic inhibition (increase in level of activity of the forebrain, arousal). When the responses of {CA}3 neurons habituate, the initial high background activity is reinstated, as well as tonic suppression of {RF}. Analysis of the second output of {CA}3 (by Schaffer's collaterals to {CA}1) shows that activity in this pathway can block access of cortical signals from {PP} to {CA}1 neurons by action upon the local system of inhibitory neurons, or by shunting the propagation of signals in apical dendrites. Thus, {CA}3 can act as a filter controlling the information transmission by {CA}1; such transmission at any given moment is allowed only in those {CA}1 neurons which receive {SC} from {CA}3 neurons, responding to the sensory stimulus by suppression of their activity. Disconnection of the {CA}3 output fibers results in disappearance of habituation in all its target structures (raphe, {RF}, {CA}1). The output signal of {CA}1-subiculum follows by postcommissural fornix to the chain of structures of the main limbic circuit: mammillary bodies (medial nucleus), anterior thalamic nuclei (mainly antero-ventral nucleus), and cingulate limbic cortex (mainly posterior area). In each of these links, the signal is additionally processed. Habituation is nearly absent in these structures; instead, strong incremental dynamics are observed. Various types of reaction shaping, often with changes in level and structure of background activity, are observed in them. Within this output circuit, the farther is the output structure from the hippocampus, the more repetitions of stimulus are required for shaping the sensory response. That is why this system is regarded as a chain of integrators, where each one starts to respond only after reaction develops at the previous link, and as a delay line, preventing premature fixation of spurious, irrelevant, low probability signals. The responses in the higher link of this system, the posterior limbic cortex, may be regarded as the ultimate signal for information fixation in the nonprimary areas of the neocortex. In this way, the two morpho-functional circuits, regulatory (based on {CA}3) and informational (based on {CA}1), perform the unified functions of attention and initial stages of memory trace fixation.

	abstract = {This article summarizes the results of studies concerning the influence of the ventral tegmental area ({VTA}) on the hippocampal theta rhythm. Temporary {VTA} inactivation resulted in transient loss of the hippocampal theta. Permanent destruction of the {VTA} caused a long-lasting depression of the power of the theta and it also had some influence on the frequency of the rhythm. Activation of glutamate ({GLU}) receptors or decrease of {GABAergic} tonus in the {VTA} led to enhancement of dopamine release and increased hippocampal theta power. High time and frequency cross-correlation was detected for the theta band between the {VTA} and hippocampus during paradoxical sleep and active waking. Thus, the {VTA} may belong to the broad network involved in theta rhythm regulation. This article also presents a model of brainstem–{VTA}–hippocampal interactions in the induction of the hippocampal theta rhythm. The projections from the {VTA} which enhance theta rhythm are incorporated into the main theta generation pathway, in which the septum acts as the central node. The neuronal activity that may be responsible for the ability of the {VTA} to regulate theta probably derives from the structures associated with rapid eye movement (sleep) ({REM}) sleep or with sensorimotor activity (i.e., mainly from the pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei and also from the raphe).

Longitudinal observation of single unit neural activity from large numbers of cortical neurons in awake and mobile animals is often a vital step in studying neural network behaviour and towards the prospect of building effective brain–machine interfaces ({BMIs}). These recordings generate enormous amounts of data for transmission and storage, and typically require offline processing to tease out the behaviour of individual neurons. Our aim was to create a compact system capable of: (1) reducing the data bandwidth by circa 2 to 3 orders of magnitude (greatly improving battery lifetime and enabling low power wireless transmission in future versions); (2) producing real-time, low-latency, spike sorted data; and (3) long term untethered operation. Approach. We have developed a headstage that operates in two phases. In the short training phase a computer is attached and classic spike sorting is performed to generate templates. In the second phase the system is untethered and performs template matching to create an event driven spike output that is logged to a micro-{SD} card. To enable validation the system is capable of logging the high bandwidth raw neural signal data as well as the spike sorted data. Main results. The system can successfully record 32 channels of raw neural signal data and/or spike sorted events for well over 24 h at a time and is robust to power dropouts during battery changes as well as {SD} card replacement. A 24 h initial recording in a non-human primate M1 showed consistent spike shapes with the expected changes in neural activity during awake behaviour and sleep cycles. Significance. The presented platform allows neural activity to be unobtrusively monitored and processed in realtime in freely behaving untethered animals—revealing insights that are not attainable through scheduled recording sessions. This system achieves the lowest power per channel to date and provides a robust, low-latency, low-bandwidth and verifiable output suitable for {BMIs}, closed loop neuromodulation, wireless transmission and long term data logging.},

Exploratory behavior plays a fundamental role in motivation, learning, and well-being of organisms. Diverse exploratory behaviors have been described, although their heterogeneity is not certain because of the lack of solid experimental evidence for their distinction. Here we present results demonstrating that different neural mechanisms underlie different exploratory behaviors. Localized Cav3.1 knockdown in the medial septum ({MS}) selectively enhanced object exploration, whereas the null mutant ({KO}) mice showed enhanced-object exploration as well as open-field exploration. In {MS} knockdown mice, only type 2 hippocampal theta rhythm was enhanced, whereas both type 1 and type 2 theta rhythm were enhanced in {KO} mice. This selective effect was accompanied by markedly increased excitability of septo-hippocampal {GABAergic} projection neurons in the {MS} lacking T-type Ca2+ channels. Furthermore, optogenetic activation of the septo-hippocampal {GABAergic} pathway in {WT} mice also selectively enhanced object exploration behavior and type 2 theta rhythm, whereas inhibition of the same pathway decreased the behavior and the rhythm. These findings define object exploration distinguished from open-field exploration and reveal a critical role of T-type Ca2+ channels in the medial septal {GABAergic} projection neurons in this behavior.},

	abstract = {Flipping behavior under threat
Could it be that the brain in a state of emergency or under intense threat operates in a fundamentally different way? Seo et al. found that mice paused when serotonin neurons were transiently stimulated in low- or medium-threat environments, but when this same neural population was stimulated in high-threat environments, mice tried to escape. Recordings from these neurons indicated that movement-related neural tuning flipped between environments. Neural activity decreased when movement was initiated in low-threat environments but increased in high-threat environments.
Science, this issue p. 538
Survival depends on the selection of behaviors adaptive for the current environment. For example, a mouse should run from a rapidly looming hawk but should freeze if the hawk is coasting across the sky. Although serotonin has been implicated in adaptive behavior, environmental regulation of its functional role remains poorly understood. In mice, we found that stimulation of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons suppressed movement in low- and moderate-threat environments but induced escape behavior in high-threat environments, and that movement-related dorsal raphe serotonin neural dynamics inverted in high-threat environments. Stimulation of dorsal raphe γ-aminobutyric acid ({GABA}) neurons promoted movement in negative but not positive environments, and movement-related {GABA} neural dynamics inverted between positive and negative environments. Thus, dorsal raphe circuits switch between distinct operational modes to promote environment-specific adaptive behaviors.
When mice sense serious danger, serotonin neurons switch their activity from movement suppression to movement facilitation.

	abstract = {Mammalian cortical structures are endowed with the capacity for plasticity, which emerges from a combination of the dynamics of circuit connectivity and function, and the intrinsic function of the neurons within the circuit. However, this capacity is accompanied by a significant risk: the capability to generate seizure discharges is also a property of all mammalian cortices. How do cortical circuits reconcile the requirement to maintain plasticity, but at the same time control seizure initiation? These issues come into particular focus in the hippocampus. The hippocampus is one of the main plasticity engines in the brain, and is also a structure frequently implicated in the generation of epileptic seizures, with temporal lobe epilepsy constituting the most prevalent form of epilepsy in the adult population. One aspect of hippocampal circuitry that is particularly prominent is its intimate interconnections with the entorhinal cortex. These interconnections create a number of excitatory synaptic loops within the limbic system, which, in addition to being important in cognitive function, can support reentrant activation and seizure generation. In the present review, using optical imaging approaches to elucidate circuit processing at high temporal and spatial resolution, we examine how two targets of entorhinal cortical input within the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus and area {CA}1, regulate these synaptic pathways in ways that can maintain functions important in generation of normal activity patterns, but that dampen the ability of these inputs to generate seizure discharges.},

This complex and articulated arrangement of current flows is reflected in the way neuronal firing is modulated in time. Several models have proposed that these different theta modulators flexibly coordinate hippocampal regions, to support associative memory formation and retrieval. Here, we summarily review different approaches related to this issue and we describe a mechanism, based on experimental and simulation results, for memory retrieval in {CA}3 involving theta modulation.},

Neuronal networks can store and retrieve discrete memories, but often fail to retrieve stored sequences. This is because error decreases over time for a static attractor, but builds up drastically over time if patterns are not trained to retrieve themselves but to retrieve the next item in a sequence. Pfeiffer and Foster studied brain activity in awake but immobile rats. Recording simultaneously from a large number of place cells in the hippocampal formation, they found that internally generated sequences alternated between periods of hovering in place while being strengthened, and periods of abrupt transition to a new place.
Science, this issue p. 180
Neuronal circuits produce self-sustaining sequences of activity patterns, but the precise mechanisms remain unknown. Here we provide evidence for autoassociative dynamics in sequence generation. During sharp-wave ripple ({SWR}) events, hippocampal neurons express sequenced reactivations, which we show are composed of discrete attractors. Each attractor corresponds to a single location, the representation of which sharpens over the course of several milliseconds, as the reactivation focuses at that location. Subsequently, the reactivation transitions rapidly to a spatially discontiguous location. This alternation between sharpening and transition occurs repeatedly within individual {SWRs} and is locked to the slow-gamma (25 to 50 hertz) rhythm. These findings support theoretical notions of neural network function and reveal a fundamental discretization in the retrieval of memory in the hippocampus, together with a function for gamma oscillations in the control of attractor dynamics.
Place cell representations of spatial trajectories in awake but immobile animals jump from one location to another.

These brief events, often termed “replay” in the scientific literature, are largely confined to non-exploratory states such as sleep or quiet rest. Early studies examining the content of replay noted a strong correlation between the encoded spatial information and the animal's prior behavior; thus, replay was initially hypothesized to play a role in memory formation and/or systems-level consolidation via “off-line” reactivation of previous experiences. However, recent findings indicate that replay may also serve as a memory retrieval mechanism to guide future behavior or may be an incidental reflection of pre-existing network assemblies. Here, I will review what is known regarding the content of replay events and their correlation with past and future actions, and I will discuss how this knowledge might inform or constrain models which seek to explain the circuit-level mechanisms underlying these events and their role in mnemonic processes.},

Using two-dimensional arrays of electrodes for recording local field potentials and unit discharges in freely moving rats, we studied the emergence of ripple oscillations (140–220 Hz) and compared their origin and cellular–synaptic mechanisms with fast gamma oscillations (90–140 Hz). We show that (1) hippocampal {SPW}-Rs and fast gamma oscillations are quantitatively distinct patterns but involve the same networks and share similar mechanisms; (2) both the frequency and magnitude of fast oscillations are positively correlated with the magnitude of {SPWs}; (3) during both ripples and fast gamma oscillations the frequency of network oscillation is higher in {CA}1 than in {CA}3; and (4) the emergence of {CA}3 population bursts, a prerequisite for {SPW}-Rs, is biased by activity patterns in the dentate gyrus and entorhinal cortex, with the highest probability of ripples associated with an “optimum” level of dentate gamma power.

Medical therapy is used as the primary method for all patients with an overactive bladder. As the drugs of choice, the use of M-cholinolytics affecting muscarinic receptors of the bladder is recommended. The article presents data indicating the possibility of using trospium chloride in patients of different age categories. Objective to determine the effectiveness of the use of M-cholinolytic drug (trospium chloride) in women of different age categories. Material and methods. The study included 68 patients with symptoms of a hyperactive bladder, which, depending on their age, were divided into 2 groups. All patients received trospium chloride (Spasmex®) for 6 months. Results. After 3 and 6 months of the use of trospium chloride in patients of both groups, the complaints decreased significantly. Attention is drawn to the fact that the decrease in the number of complaints during the treatment significantly decreased more in the first three months. In women of the reproductive period, the results are more significant than in postmenopausal patients, which can be explained by the presence of hypoestrogenic condition in patients of the 2nd group, which can make the pathology worse and require the appointment of etiopathogenetic treatment. Conclusion. Trospium chloride can be recommended to patients reproductive and postmenopausal periods for relief of symptoms of overactive bladder with the contraindications. In postmenopausal women, in addition to taking trospium chloride, the need to prescribe menopausal hormone therapy (systemic, local) should be considered to compensate for the deficiency of estrogen. In the presence of prolapse of the genitals and stress component of urinary incontinence, it is necessary to resolve the issue of the need for timely surgical treatment aimed at coping with stress urinary incontinence and correction of prolapse of the genitals.},

Increased levels of acetylcholine in the hippocampal formation are associated with successful encoding while disruption of the cholinergic system leads to impairments on a range of mnemonic tasks. Cholinergic signalling from the medial septum also plays a central role in generating and pacing theta-band oscillations throughout the hippocampal formation. New results suggest a potential link between these distinct phenomena. Environmental novelty, a condition associated with strong cholinergic drive, has been shown to induce an expansion in the firing pattern of entorhinal grid cells and a reduction in the frequency of theta measured from the {LFP}. Computational modelling suggests the spatial activity of grid cells is produced by interference between neuronal oscillators; scale being determined by theta-band oscillations in entorhinal stellate cells, the frequency of which are modulated by acetylcholine. We propose a causal link: increased cholinergic signalling in response to environmental novelty triggers grid expansion. Cholinergic induced grid expansion may enhance, or even induce, encoding by producing a mismatch between spatial inputs to the hippocampus, such as barrier cells and grids cell with different scales.},

By using a detailed simulation of intracerebral recordings, we show that this is able to reproduce both the theta-nested gamma oscillations that are seen in awake brains and the sharp-wave ripple complexes measured during slow-wave sleep. The results of our simulations support the idea that the functional connectivity of the hippocampus, modulated by the sleep-wake variations in Acetylcholine concentration, is a key factor in controlling its rhythms.},

	abstract = {The entorhinal–hippocampal system is an important circuit in the brain, essential for certain cognitive tasks such as memory and navigation. Different gamma oscillations occur in this circuit, with the medial entorhinal cortex ({mEC}), {CA}3 and {CA}1 all generating gamma oscillations with different properties. These three gamma oscillations converge within {CA}1, where much work has gone into trying to isolate them from each other. Here, we compared the gamma generators in the {mEC}, {CA}3 and {CA}1 using optogenetically induced theta–gamma oscillations. Expressing channelrhodopsin‐2 in principal neurons in each of the three regions allowed for the induction of gamma oscillations via sinusoidal blue light stimulation at theta frequency. Recording the oscillations in {CA}1 in vivo, we found that {CA}3 stimulation induced slower gamma oscillations than {CA}1 stimulation, matching in vivo reports of spontaneous {CA}3 and {CA}1 gamma oscillations. In brain slices ex vivo, optogenetic stimulation of {CA}3 induced slower gamma oscillations than stimulation of either {mEC} or {CA}1, whose gamma oscillations were of similar frequency. All three gamma oscillations had a current sink–source pair between the perisomatic and dendritic layers of the same region. Taking advantage of this model to analyse gamma frequency mechanisms in slice, we showed using pharmacology that all three gamma oscillations were dependent on the same types of synaptic receptor, being abolished by blockade of either type A γ‐aminobutyric acid receptors or α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid/kainate receptors, and insensitive to blockade of N‐methyl‐d‐aspartate receptors. These results indicate that a fast excitatory–inhibitory feedback loop underlies the generation of gamma oscillations in all three regions.},

We used functional ultrasound ({fUS}) imaging concurrently with extracellular recordings of local field potentials ({LFP}) to reveal brain-wide spatiotemporal hemodynamics of single {REMS} episodes. We demonstrate for the first time the close association between global hyperemic events - largely outmatching wake levels in most brain regions - and local hippocampal theta (6-10 Hz) and fast gamma (80-110 Hz) events in the {CA}1 region. In particular, the power of fast gamma oscillations strongly correlated with the amplitude of subsequent vascular events.

In novel object tasks, the degree of hippocampal dependence has been reported to vary depending on the type of novelty (Eichenbaum et al., 2007; Winters et al., 2008). Therefore, gamma activity was examined during three novelty conditions: a novel object presented in a location where a familiar object had been ({NO}), a familiar object presented in a location where no object had been ({NL}), and a novel object presented in a location where no object had been ({NO}+{NL}). The strongest and most consistent effects were observed for fast gamma rhythms during the {NO}+{NL} condition. Fast gamma power, {CA}3–{CA}1 phase synchrony, and phase-locking of place cell spikes increased during exploration of novel, compared to familiar, object–place associations. Additionally, place cell spiking during exploration of novel object–place pairings was increased when fast gamma rhythms were present. These results suggest that fast gamma rhythms promote encoding of memories for novel object–place associations.},

	abstract = {Theta oscillations are a prominent rhythm of the brain occurring during active behavior and rapid eye movement sleep and thought to provide the temporal frame for the encoding of information. Acetylcholine modulation is a major player in hippocampal theta rhythm, as demonstrated by lesion and pharmacological manipulations of cholinergic receptors, yet the link between the activity of septal cholinergic neurons and the theta rhythm is not fully understood. We used specific optogenetic stimulation of the septo-hippocampal cholinergic neurons in the anesthetized and behaving mouse to decipher the effects of cholinergic stimulation on hippocampal network activity and show that in addition to promoting theta oscillations it suppresses sharp wave ripples and peri-theta band activity., Theta oscillations in the limbic system depend on the integrity of the medial septum. The different populations of medial septal neurons (cholinergic and {GABAergic}) are assumed to affect different aspects of theta oscillations. Using optogenetic stimulation of cholinergic neurons in {ChAT}-Cre mice, we investigated their effects on hippocampal local field potentials in both anesthetized and behaving mice. Cholinergic stimulation completely blocked sharp wave ripples and strongly suppressed the power of both slow oscillations (0.5–2 Hz in anesthetized, 0.5–4 Hz in behaving animals) and supratheta (6–10 Hz in anesthetized, 10–25 Hz in behaving animals) bands. The same stimulation robustly increased both the power and coherence of theta oscillations (2–6 Hz) in urethane-anesthetized mice. In behaving mice, cholinergic stimulation was less effective in the theta (4–10 Hz) band yet it also increased the ratio of theta/slow oscillation and theta coherence. The effects on gamma oscillations largely mirrored those of theta. These findings show that medial septal cholinergic activation can both enhance theta rhythm and suppress peri-theta frequency bands, allowing theta oscillations to dominate.},

Here, we examine the activity of hippocampal interneurons during gamma oscillations in mouse {CA}1, using an in vitro model where brief epochs of rhythmic activity were evoked by local application of kainate. We found that this {CA}1 {KA}-evoked gamma oscillation was faster than that in {CA}3 and, crucially, did not appear to require the involvement of fast-spiking basket cells. In contrast to {CA}3, we also found that optogenetic inhibition of pyramidal cells in {CA}1 did not significantly affect the power of the oscillation, suggesting that excitation may not be essential for gamma genesis in this region. We found that {MGE}-derived interneurons were generally more active than {CGE} interneurons during {CA}1 gamma, although a group of {CGE}-derived interneurons, putative trilaminar cells, were strongly phase-locked with gamma oscillations and, together with {MGE}-derived axo-axonic and bistratified cells, provide attractive candidates for being the driver of this locally generated, predominantly interneuron-driven model of gamma oscillations.},

Despite extensive study of these rhythms in the entorhinal cortex, dentate gyrus, {CA}3, and {CA}1, almost nothing is known regarding their generation and organization in the structure delivering the most prominent hippocampal output: the subiculum. Here we show using a complete rat hippocampal preparation in vitro that the subiculum intrinsically and independently generates spontaneous slow (25–50 Hz) and fast (100–150 Hz) gamma rhythms during the rising phase and peak of persistent subicular theta rhythms. These two gamma frequencies are phase modulated by theta rhythms without any form of afferent input from the entorhinal cortex or {CA}1. Subicular principal cells and interneurons phase lock to both fast and slow gamma, and single cells are independently phase modulated by each form of gamma rhythm, enabling selective participation in neural synchrony at both gamma frequencies at different times. Fast {GABAergic} inhibition is required for the generation of fast gamma, whereas slow gamma is generated by excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms. In addition, the transverse subicular axis exhibits gamma rhythm topography with faster gamma coupling arising in the distal subiculum region. The subiculum therefore possesses a unique intrinsic circuit organization that can autonomously regulate the timing and topography of hippocampal output synchronization. These results suggest the subiculum is a third spontaneous gamma generator in the hippocampal formation (in addition to {CA}3 and the entorhinal cortex), and these gamma rhythms likely play an active role in mediating the flow of information between the hippocampus and multiple cortical and subcortical brain regions.},

	abstract = {The dendrites of pyramidal cells are active compartments capable of independent computations, input ⁄ output transformation and synaptic plasticity. Pyramidal cells in the {CA}1 area of the hippocampus receive 92\% of their {GABAergic} input onto dendrites. How does this {GABAergic} input participate in dendritic computations of pyramidal cells? One key to understanding their contribution to dendritic computation lies in the timing of {GABAergic} input in relation to excitatory transmission, back-propagating action potentials, Ca2+ spikes and subthreshold membrane dynamics. The issue is further complicated by the fact that dendritic {GABAergic} inputs originate from numerous distinct sources operating with different molecular machineries and innervating different subcellular domains of pyramidal cell dendrites. The {GABAergic} input from distinct sources is likely to contribute differentially to dendritic computations. In this review, I describe four groups of {GABAergic} interneuron according to their expression of parvalbumin, cholecystokinin, axonal arborization density and long-range projections. These four interneuron groups contain at least 12 distinct cell types, which innervate mainly or exclusively the dendrites of {CA}1 pyramidal cells. Furthermore, I summarize the different spike timing of distinct interneuron types during gamma, theta and ripple oscillations in vivo, and I discuss some of the open questions on how {GABAergic} input modulates dendritic operations in {CA}1 pyramidal cells.},

	abstract = {In the hippocampal {CA}1 area, the {GABAergic} trilaminar cells have their axon distributed locally in three layers and also innervate the subiculum. Trilaminar cells have a high level of somato-dendritic muscarinic M2 acetylcholine receptor, lack somatostatin expression and their presynaptic inputs are enriched in {mGluR}8a. But the origin of their inputs and their behaviour-dependent activity remain to be characterised. Here we demonstrate that (1) {GABAergic} neurons with the molecular features of trilaminar cells are present in {CA}1 and {CA}3 in both rats and mice. (2) Trilaminar cells receive {mGluR}8a-enriched {GABAergic} inputs, e.g. from the medial septum, which are probably susceptible to hetero-synaptic modulation of neurotransmitter release by group {III} {mGluRs}. (3) An electron microscopic analysis identifies trilaminar cell output synapses with specialised postsynaptic densities and a strong bias towards interneurons as targets, including parvalbumin-expressing cells in the {CA}1 area. (4) Recordings in freely moving rats revealed the network state-dependent segregation of trilaminar cell activity, with reduced firing during movement, but substantial increase in activity with prolonged burst firing ({\textgreater} 200 Hz) during slow wave sleep. We predict that the behaviour-dependent temporal dynamics of trilaminar cell firing are regulated by their specialised inhibitory inputs. Trilaminar cells might support glutamatergic principal cells by disinhibition and mediate the binding of neuronal assemblies between the hippocampus and the subiculum via the transient inhibition of local interneurons.},

	abstract = {Information processing within neuronal networks is determined by a dynamic partnership between principal neurons and local circuit inhibitory interneurons. The population of {GABAergic} interneurons is extremely heterogeneous and comprises, in many brain regions, cells with divergent morphological and physiological properties, distinct molecular expression profiles, and highly specialized functions. {GABAergic} interneurons have been studied extensively during the past two decades, especially in the hippocampus, which is a relatively simple cortical structure. Different types of hippocampal inhibitory interneurons control spike initiation (e.g., axo-axonic and basket cells) and synaptic integration (e.g., bistratified and oriens–lacunosum moleculare interneurons) within pyramidal neurons and synchronize local network activity, providing a means for functional segregation of neuronal ensembles and proper routing of hippocampal information. Thus, it is thought that, at least in the hippocampus, {GABAergic} inhibitory interneurons represent critical regulating elements at all stages of information processing, from synaptic integration and spike generation to large-scale network activity. However, this raises an important question: if inhibitory interneurons are fundamental for network computations, what are the mechanisms that control the activity of the interneurons themselves? Given the essential role of synaptic inhibition in the regulation of neuronal activity, it would be logical to expect that specific inhibitory mechanisms have evolved to control the operation of interneurons. Here, we review the mechanisms of synaptic inhibition of interneurons and discuss their role in the operation of hippocampal inhibitory circuits.},

	abstract = {When monitoring neural activity using intracranial electrical recordings, researchers typically consider the signals to have two primary components: fast action potentials ({APs}) from neurons near the electrode, and the slower local field potential ({LFP}), thought to be dominated by postsynaptic currents integrated over a larger volume of tissue. In general, a decrease in signal power with increasing frequency is observed for most brain rhythms. The 100–200 Hz oscillations in the rat hippocampus, including “fast gamma” or “epsilon” oscillations and sharp wave-ripples ({SPW}-Rs), are one exception, showing an increase in power with frequency within this band. We have used detailed biophysical modeling to investigate the composition of extracellular potentials during fast oscillations in rat {CA}1. We find that postsynaptic currents exhibit a decreasing ability to generate large-amplitude oscillatory signals at high frequencies, whereas phase-modulated spiking shows the opposite trend. Our estimates indicate that {APs} and postsynaptic currents contribute similar proportions of the power contained in 140–200 Hz ripples, and the two combined generate a signal that closely resembles in vivo {SPW}-Rs. Much of the {AP}-generated signal originates from neurons further than 100 μm from the recording site, consistent with ripples appearing similarly strong regardless of whether or not they contain recognizable {APs}. Additionally, substantial power can be generated in the 90–150 Hz epsilon band by the {APs} of rhythmically firing pyramidal neurons. Thus, high-frequency {LFPs} may generally contain signatures of local cell assembly activation.},

The cells were found to display a variety of bursting patterns phase-locked to hippocampal theta rhythm to a greater or lesser degree. Among phase-locked cells, no systematic distribution in preferential phase could be found, and these cells were shown to maintain their preferential phase for extended periods. Cells were classified into those which showed signs of a broadening of the repolarization phase of their action potential (‘inflected’: putative cholinergic) and those without (‘non-inflected’: putative {GABAergic}). Non-inflected cells tended to fire rhythmic bursts while inflected cells mostly fired in an irregular fashion, although still significantly phase-locked to hippocampal theta. In neither population did the phase-locked cells show any coherent distribution of their preferential phase. Sixty-five per cent of the rhythmically bursting cells showed a significant correlation between the interburst frequency and the animal’s running speed. Five cells displayed rhythmic activity only when the rat ran in a specific direction.

	abstract = {Abstract Sharp wave-ripples (140?220?Hz) are patterns of brain activity observed in the local field potential of the hippocampus which are present during memory consolidation. As rodents switch from memory consolidation to memory encoding behaviors, cholinergic inputs to the hippocampus from neurons in the medial septum-diagonal band of Broca cause a marked reduction in ripple incidence. The mechanism for this disruption in ripple power is not fully understood. In isolated neurons, the major effect of cholinergic input on hippocampal neurons is depolarization of the membrane potential, which affects both hippocampal pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. Using an existing model of ripple-frequency oscillations that includes both pyramidal neurons and interneurons, we investigated the mechanism whereby depolarizing inputs to these neurons can affect ripple power and frequency. We observed that ripple power and frequency are maintained, as long as inputs to pyramidal neurons and interneurons are balanced. Preferential drive to pyramidal neurons or interneurons, however, affects ripple power and can disrupt ripple oscillations by pushing ripple frequency higher or lower. Thus, an imbalance in drive to pyramidal neurons and interneurons provides a means whereby cholinergic input can suppress hippocampal ripples.},

	abstract = {The dentate hilus has been extensively studied in relation to its potential role in memory and in temporal lobe epilepsy. Little is known, however, about the synapses formed between the two major cell types in this region, glutamatergic mossy cells and hilar interneurons, or the organization of local circuits involving these cells. Using triple and quadruple simultaneous intracellular recordings in rat hippocampal slices, we find that mossy cells evoke {EPSPs} with high failure rates onto hilar neurons. Mossy cells show profound synapse specificity; 87.5\% of their intralamellar connections are onto hilar interneurons. Hilar interneurons also show synapse specificity and preferentially inhibit mossy cells; 81\% of inhibitory hilar synapses are onto mossy cells. Hilar {IPSPs} have low failure rates, are blocked by the {GABAA} receptor antagonist gabazine, and exhibit short-term depression when tested at 17 Hz. Surprisingly, more than half (57\%) of the mossy cell synapses we found onto interneurons were part of reciprocal excitatory/inhibitory local circuit motifs. Neither the high degree of target cell specificity, nor the significant enrichment of structured polysynaptic local circuit motifs, could be explained by nonrandom sampling or somatic proximity. Intralamellar hilar synapses appear to function primarily by integrating synchronous inputs and presynaptic burst discharges, allowing hilar cells to respond over a large dynamic range of input strengths. The reciprocal mossy cell/interneuron local circuit motifs we find enriched in the hilus may generate sparse neural representations involved in hippocampal memory operations.},

	abstract = {{GABAergic} inhibitory interneurons control fundamental aspects of neuronal network function. Their functional roles are assumed to be defined by the identity of their input synapses, the architecture of their dendritic tree, the passive and active membrane properties and finally the nature of their postsynaptic targets. Indeed, interneurons display a high degree of morphological and physiological heterogeneity. However, whether their morphological and physiological characteristics are correlated and whether interneuron diversity can be described by a continuum of {GABAergic} cell types or by distinct classes has remained unclear. Here we perform a detailed morphological and physiological characterization of {GABAergic} cells in the dentate gyrus, the input region of the hippocampus. To achieve an unbiased and efficient sampling and classification we used knock-in mice expressing the enhanced green fluorescent protein ({eGFP}) in glutamate decarboxylase 67 ({GAD}67)-positive neurons and performed cluster analysis. We identified five interneuron classes, each of them characterized by a distinct set of anatomical and physiological parameters. Cross-correlation analysis further revealed a direct relation between morphological and physiological properties indicating that dentate gyrus interneurons fall into functionally distinct classes which may differentially control neuronal network activity. © 2013 The Authors.

	abstract = {Hippocampal {GABAergic} cells are highly heterogeneous, but the functional significance of this diversity is not fully understood. By using paired recordings of synaptically connected interneurons in slice preparations of the rat and mouse dentate gyrus ({DG}), we show that morphologically identified interneurons form complex neuronal networks. Synaptic inhibitory interactions exist between cholecystokinin ({CCK})-expressing hilar commissural associational path ({HICAP}) cells and among somatostatin ({SOM})-containing hilar perforant path-associated ({HIPP}) interneurons. Moreover, both interneuron types inhibit parvalbumin ({PV})-expressing perisomatic inhibitory basket cells ({BCs}), whereas {BCs} and {HICAPs} rarely target {HIPP} cells. {HICAP} and {HIPP} cells produce slow, weak, and unreliable inhibition onto postsynaptic interneurons. The time course of inhibitory signaling is defined by the identity of the presynaptic and postsynaptic cell. It is the slowest for {HIPP}–{HIPP}, intermediately slow for {HICAP}–{HICAP}, but fast for {BC}–{BC} synapses. {GABA} release at interneuron–interneuron synapses also shows cell type-specific short-term dynamics, ranging from multiple-pulse facilitation at {HICAP}–{HICAP}, biphasic modulation at {HIPP}–{HIPP} to depression at {BC}–{BC} synapses. Although dendritic inhibition at {HICAP}–{BC} and {HIPP}–{BC} synapses appears weak and slow, channelrhodopsin 2-mediated excitation of {SOM} terminals demonstrates that they effectively control the activity of target interneurons. They markedly reduce the discharge probability but sharpen the temporal precision of action potential generation. Thus, dendritic inhibition seems to play an important role in determining the activity pattern of {GABAergic} interneuron populations and thereby the flow of information through the {DG} circuitry.},

Hilar-perforant-path-associated interneurons ({HIPP} cells) have been considered to be synonymous for {DG}-{SOMIs}. Deviating from this assumption, we show two functionally contrasting {DG}-{SOMI}-types. The classical feedback-inhibitory {HIPPs} distribute axon fibers in the molecular layer. They are engaged by converging {GC}-inputs and provide dendritic inhibition to the {DG} circuitry. In contrast, {SOMIs} with axon in the hilus, termed hilar interneurons ({HILs}), provide perisomatic inhibition onto {GABAergic} cells in the {DG} and project to the medial septum. Repetitive activation of glutamatergic inputs onto {HIPP} cells induces long-lasting-depression ({LTD}) of synaptic transmission but long-term-potentiation ({LTP}) of synaptic signals in {HIL} cells. Thus, {LTD} in {HIPPs} may assist flow of spatial information from the entorhinal cortex to the {DG}, whereas {LTP} in {HILs} may facilitate the temporal coordination of {GCs} with activity patterns governed by the medial septum., {DOI}:

	abstract = {Hilar mossy cells are the prominent glutamatergic cell type in the dentate hilus of the dentate gyrus ({DG}); they have been proposed to have critical roles in the {DG} network. To better understand how mossy cells contribute to {DG} function, we have applied new viral genetic and functional circuit mapping approaches to quantitatively map and compare local and long-range circuit connections of mossy cells and dentate granule cells in the mouse. The great majority of inputs to mossy cells consist of two parallel inputs from within the {DG}: an excitatory input pathway from dentate granule cells and an inhibitory input pathway from local {DG} inhibitory neurons. Mossy cells also receive a moderate degree of excitatory and inhibitory {CA}3 input from proximal {CA}3 subfields. Long range inputs to mossy cells are numerically sparse, and they are only identified readily from the medial septum and the septofimbrial nucleus. In comparison, dentate granule cells receive most of their inputs from the entorhinal cortex. The granule cells receive significant synaptic inputs from the hilus and the medial septum, and they also receive direct inputs from both distal and proximal {CA}3 subfields, which has been underdescribed in the existing literature. Our slice-based physiological mapping studies further supported the identified circuit connections of mossy cells and granule cells. Together, our data suggest that hilar mossy cells are major local circuit integrators and they exert modulation of the activity of dentate granule cells as well as the {CA}3 region through “back-projection” pathways.},

	abstract = {Hippocampal ({HPC}) theta oscillations have long been linked to various functions of the brain. Many cortical and subcortical areas that also exhibit theta oscillations have been linked to functional circuits with the hippocampus on the basis of coupled activities at theta frequencies. We examine, in freely moving rats, the characteristics of diencephalic theta local field potentials ({LFPs}) recorded in the supramammillary/mammillary ({SuM}/{MM}) areas that are bi-directionally connected to the {HPC} through the septal complex. Using partial directed coherence, we find support for previous suggestions that {SuM} modulates {HPC} theta at higher frequencies. We find weak separation of {SuM} and {MM} by dominant theta frequency recorded locally. Contrary to oscillatory cell activities under anaesthesia where {SuM} is insensitive, but {MM} is sensitive to medial septal ({MS}) inactivation, theta {LFPs} persisted and became indistinguishable after {MS}-inactivation. However, {MS}-inactivation attenuated {SuM}/{MM} theta power, while increasing the frequency of {SuM}/{MM} theta. {MS}-inactivation also reduced root mean squared power in both {HPC} and {SuM}/{MM} equally, but reduced theta power differentially in the time domain. We provide converging evidence that {SuM} is preferentially involved in coding {HPC} theta at higher frequencies, and that the {MS}-{HPC} circuit normally imposes a frequency-limiting modulation over the {SuM}/{MM} area as suggested by cell-based recordings in anaesthetised animals. In addition, we provide evidence that the postulated {SuM}-{MS}-{HPC}-{MM} circuit is under complex bi-directional control, rather than {SuM} and {MM} having roles as unidirectional relays in the network.},

	abstract = {Acetylcholine is a key modulator of hippocampal and entorhinal cortex ({EC}) function. The majority of cholinergic projections targeting these structures originate in the basal forebrain complex, specifically the medial septum. Many studies focused on the behavioral effects involving these projections, but there still is a paucity regarding their connectivity in the target area. Here we provide this missing link. By combining optogenetics with whole-cell recordings in superficial {EC} layers, we identified the synaptic target cells of septal cholinergic neurons. This level of analysis is an important step toward a better understanding of the modulatory action of acetylcholine in {EC} in vivo., The entorhinal cortex ({EC}) plays a pivotal role in processing and conveying spatial information to the hippocampus. It has long been known that {EC} neurons are modulated by cholinergic input from the medial septum. However, little is known as to how synaptic release of acetylcholine affects the different cell types in {EC}. Here we combined optogenetics and patch-clamp recordings to study the effect of cholinergic axon stimulation on distinct neurons in {EC}. We found dense cholinergic innervations that terminate in layer I and {II} ({LI} and {LII}). Light-activated stimulation of septal cholinergic projections revealed differential responses in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in {LI} and {LII} of both medial and lateral {EC}. We observed depolarizing responses mediated by nicotinic and muscarinic receptors primarily in putative serotonin receptor (p5HT3R)-expressing interneurons. Hyperpolarizing muscarinic receptor-mediated responses were found predominantly in excitatory cells. Additionally, some excitatory as well as a higher fraction of inhibitory neurons received mono- and/or polysynaptic {GABAergic} inputs, revealing that medial septum cholinergic neurons have the capacity to corelease {GABA} alongside acetylcholine. Notably, the synaptic effects of acetylcholine were similar in neurons of both medial and lateral {EC}. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that {EC} activity may be differentially modulated via the activation or the suppression of distinct subsets of {LI} and {LII} neurons by the septal cholinergic system.},

	abstract = {In classical fear conditioning, a neutral conditioned stimulus ({CS}) is paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus ({US}), which leads to a fear memory. If the {CS} is repeatedly presented without the {US} after fear conditioning, the formation of an extinction memory occurs, which inhibits fear memory expression. A previous study has demonstrated that selective cholinergic lesions in the medial septum and vertical limb of the diagonal bands of Broca ({MS}/{vDBB}) prior to fear and extinction learning disrupt contextual fear memory discrimination and acquisition of extinction memory. {MS}/{vDBB} cholinergic neurons project to a number of substrates that are critical for fear and extinction memory. However, it is currently unknown which of these efferent projections are critical for contextual fear memory discrimination and extinction memory. To address this, we induced cholinergic lesions in efferent targets of {MS}/{vDBB} cholinergic neurons. These included the dorsal hippocampus ({dHipp}), ventral hippocampus ({vHipp}), medial prefrontal cortex ({mPFC}), and in the {mPFC} and {dHipp} combined. None of these lesion groups exhibited deficits in contextual fear memory discrimination or extinction memory. However, {vHipp} cholinergic lesions disrupted auditory fear memory. Because {MS}/{vDBB} cholinergic neurons are the sole source of acetylcholine in the {vHipp}, these results suggest that {MS}/{vDBB} cholinergic input to the {vHipp} is critical for auditory fear memory. Taken together with previous findings, the results of this study suggest that {MS}/{vDBB} cholinergic neurons are critical for fear and extinction memory, though further research is needed to elucidate the role of {MS}/{vDBB} cholinergic neurons in these types of emotional memory.},

While central to this network are medial temporal lobe structures with a widely appreciated crucial function of the hippocampus, neocortical areas such as the posterior parietal cortex and the retrosplenial cortex also play essential roles. Since the hippocampus receives its main subcortical input from the medial septum of the basal forebrain ({BF}) cholinergic system, it is not surprising that the potential role of the septo-hippocampal pathway in spatial navigation has been investigated in many studies. Much less is known of the involvement in spatial cognition of the parallel projection system linking the posterior {BF} with neocortical areas. Here we review the current state of the art of the division of labour within this complex ‘navigation system’, with special focus on how subcortical cholinergic inputs may regulate various aspects of spatial learning, memory and navigation.},

Individual medial septal neurons display diverse activity patterns, which may be related to their termination in different cortical areas and/or to the different types of innervated interneurons. To test these hypotheses, we extracellularly recorded and juxtacellularly labeled single medial septal neurons in anesthetized rats in vivo during hippocampal theta and ripple oscillations, traced their axons to distant cortical target areas, and analyzed their postsynaptic interneurons. Medial septal {GABAergic} neurons exhibiting different hippocampal theta phase preferences and/or sharp wave-ripple related activity terminated in restricted hippocampal regions, and selectively targeted a limited number of interneuron types, as established on the basis of molecular markers. We demonstrate the preferential innervation of bistratified cells in {CA}1 and of basket cells in {CA}3 by individual axons. One group of septal neurons was suppressed during sharp wave-ripples, maintained their firing rate across theta and non-theta network states and mainly fired along the descending phase of {CA}1 theta oscillations. In contrast, neurons that were active during sharp wave-ripples increased their firing significantly during “theta” compared to “non-theta” states, with most firing during the ascending phase of theta oscillations.

	abstract = {The medial septum implements cortical theta oscillations, a 5–12 Hz rhythm associated with locomotion and paradoxical sleep reflecting synchronization of neuronal assemblies such as place cell sequence coding. Highly rhythmic burst-firing parvalbumin-positive {GABAergic} medial septal neurons are strongly coupled to theta oscillations and target cortical {GABAergic} interneurons, contributing to coordination within one or several cortical regions. However, a large population of medial septal neurons of unidentified neurotransmitter phenotype and with unknown axonal target areas fire with a low degree of rhythmicity. We investigated whether low-rhythmic-firing neurons ({LRNs}) innervated similar or different cortical regions to high-rhythmic-firing neurons ({HRNs}) and assessed their temporal dynamics in awake male mice. The majority of {LRNs} were {GABAergic} and parvalbumin-immunonegative, some expressing calbindin; they innervated interneurons mostly in the dentate gyrus ({DG}) and {CA}3. Individual {LRNs} showed several distinct firing patterns during immobility and locomotion, forming a parallel inhibitory stream for the modulation of cortical interneurons. Despite their fluctuating firing rates, the preferred firing phase of {LRNs} during theta oscillations matched the highest firing probability phase of principal cells in the {DG} and {CA}3. In addition, as a population, {LRNs} were markedly suppressed during hippocampal sharp-wave ripples, had a low burst incidence, and several of them did not fire on all theta cycles. Therefore, {CA}3 receives {GABAergic} input from both {HRNs} and {LRNs}, but the {DG} receives mainly {LRN} input. We propose that distinct {GABAergic} {LRNs} contribute to changing the excitability of the {DG} and {CA}3 during memory discrimination via transient disinhibition of principal cells.
{SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT} For the encoding and recall of episodic memories, nerve cells in the cerebral cortex are activated in precisely timed sequences. Rhythmicity facilitates the coordination of neuronal activity and these rhythms are detected as oscillations of different frequencies such as 5–12 Hz theta oscillations. Degradation of these rhythms, such as through neurodegeneration, causes memory deficits. The medial septum, a part of the basal forebrain that innervates the hippocampal formation, contains high- and low-rhythmic-firing neurons ({HRNs} and {LRNs}, respectively), which may contribute differentially to cortical neuronal coordination. We discovered that {GABAergic} {LRNs} preferentially innervate the dentate gyrus and the {CA}3 area of the hippocampus, regions important for episodic memory. These neurons act in parallel with the {HRNs} mostly via transient inhibition of inhibitory neurons.},

Furthermore, this information can be replayed in a compressed format in either forward or reverse modes during sharp wave-ripples ({SPW}-Rs). We leveraged state-of-the-art techniques in training recurrent spiking networks to demonstrate how primarily interneuron networks can achieve the following: (1) generate internal theta sequences to bind externally elicited spikes in the presence of inhibition from the medial septum; (2) compress learned spike sequences in the form of a {SPW}-R when septal inhibition is removed; (3) generate and refine high-frequency assemblies during {SPW}-R-mediated compression; and (4) regulate the inter-{SPW} interval timing between {SPW}-Rs in ripple clusters. From the fast timescale of neurons to the slow timescale of behaviors, interneuron networks serve as the scaffolding for one-shot learning by replaying, reversing, refining, and regulating spike sequences.},

To clarify the role of septal circuits and theta in location-specific activity of place cells and spatial behavior, three drugs were delivered to the medial septum of rats: Tetracaine, a local anesthetic; muscimol, a {GABA}-A agonist; and gabazine, a {GABA}-A antagonist. All three drugs disrupted normal oscillatory activity in the hippocampus. However, tetracaine and muscimol both reduced spatial firing and interfered with the rat's ability to navigate to a hidden goal. After gabazine, location-specific firing was preserved in the absence of theta, but rats were unable to accurately locate the hidden goal. These results indicate that theta is unnecessary for location-specific firing of hippocampal cells, and that place cell activity cannot support accurate navigation when septal circuits are disrupted.},

This observation reflects a navigational strategy called path integration, a strategy also utilized by mammals. Path integration necessitates that animals keep track of their movement speed and use it to precisely and instantly modify where they think they are and where they want to go. Here we review the neural circuitry that has evolved to integrate speed and space. We start with the rate and temporal codes for speed in the hippocampus and work backwards towards the motor and sensory systems. We highlight the need for experiments designed to differentiate the respective contributions of motor efference copy versus sensory inputs. In particular, we discuss the importance of high-resolution tracking of the latency of speed-encoding as a precise way to disentangle the sensory versus motor computations that enable successful spatial navigation at very different speeds.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.biopsych.2019.11.014},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Previous studies indicated the involvement of cholinergic neurons in seizure; however, the specific role of the medial septum ({MS})-hippocampus cholinergic circuit in temporal lobe epilepsy ({TLE}) has not yet been completely elucidated.
{METHODS}: In the current study, we used magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging to characterize the pathological change of the {MS}-hippocampus circuit in 42 patients with {TLE} compared with 22 healthy volunteers. Using optogenetics and chemogenetics, combined with in vivo or in vitro electrophysiology and retrograde rabies virus tracing, we revealed a direct {MS}-hippocampus cholinergic circuit that potently attenuates seizure through driving somatostatin inhibition in animal {TLE} models.
{RESULTS}: We found that patients with {TLE} with hippocampal sclerosis showed a decrease of neuronal fiber connectivity of the {MS}-hippocampus compared with healthy people. In the mouse {TLE} model, {MS} cholinergic neurons ceased firing during hippocampal seizures. Optogenetic and chemogenetic activation of {MS} cholinergic neurons (but not glutamatergic or {GABAergic} [gamma-aminobutyric acidergic] neurons) significantly attenuated hippocampal seizures, while specific inhibition promoted hippocampal seizures. Electrophysiology combined with modified rabies virus tracing studies showed that direct (but not indirect) {MS}-hippocampal cholinergic projections mediated the antiseizure effect by preferentially targeting hippocampal {GABAergic} neurons. Furthermore, chemogenetic inhibition of hippocampal somatostatin-positive (rather than parvalbumin-positive) subtype of {GABAergic} neurons reversed the antiseizure effect of the {MS}-hippocampus cholinergic circuit, which was mimicked by activating somatostatin-positive neurons.
{CONCLUSIONS}: These findings underscore the notable antiseizure role of the direct cholinergic {MS}-hippocampus circuit in {TLE} through driving the downstream somatostatin effector. This may provide a better understanding of the changes of the seizure circuit and the precise spatiotemporal control of epilepsy.},

Trilaminar cells have a high level of somato-dendritic muscarinic M2 acetylcholine receptor, lack somatostatin expression and their presynaptic inputs are enriched in {mGluR}8a. But the origin of their inputs and their behaviour-dependent activity remain to be characterised. Here we demonstrate that (1) {GABAergic} neurons with the molecular features of trilaminar cells are present in {CA}1 and {CA}3 in both rats and mice. (2) Trilaminar cells receive {mGluR}8a-enriched {GABAergic} inputs, e.g. from the medial septum, which are probably susceptible to hetero-synaptic modulation of neurotransmitter release by group {III} {mGluRs}. (3) An electron microscopic analysis identifies trilaminar cell output synapses with specialised postsynaptic densities and a strong bias towards interneurons as targets, including parvalbumin-expressing cells in the {CA}1 area. (4) Recordings in freely moving rats revealed the network state-dependent segregation of trilaminar cell activity, with reduced firing during movement, but substantial increase in activity with prolonged burst firing ({\textgreater} 200 Hz) during slow wave sleep. We predict that the behaviour-dependent temporal dynamics of trilaminar cell firing are regulated by their specialised inhibitory inputs. Trilaminar cells might support glutamatergic principal cells by disinhibition and mediate the binding of neuronal assemblies between the hippocampus and the subiculum via the transient inhibition of local interneurons.},

We have observed that the frequency of stepping rhythm in head-fixed mice running on a jetball overlaps with the range of frequencies that characterize hippocampal rhythmic slow activity, including theta ({\textasciitilde} 3 to 10 Hz). On average, step-cycle troughs (i.e. when the paw touches the ground) were weakly coupled to hippocampal theta oscillations. This weak coupling was sustained during a range of running speeds. In short temporal windows, step-cycle troughs were synchronous with hippocampal theta oscillatory cycle troughs, while during other periods they led or lagged behind theta cycles. Furthermore, simultaneously recorded theta rhythmic medial septal neurons in the basal forebrain were phase-coupled to both step-cycles and theta-cycles. We propose that the weak overall phase relationship of step-cycles with theta-cycles signifies a distinct mode of information processing. Transient synchronization of the step-cycle with theta may indicate the engagement of septo-hippocampal-entorhinal network with the current heading of the animal.},

	abstract = {The characteristic electroencephalographic patterns within the hippocampus are theta and sharp waves. Septal neurons are believed to play an essential role in the rhythm generation of the theta pattern. The present study examined the physiological consequences of complete and selective damage of septohippocampal cholinergic neurons on hippocampal theta activity in rats. A selective immunotoxin against nerve growth factor receptor bearing cholinergic neurons (192 immunoglobulin G-saporin), [Wiley R.G. et al. (1991) Brain Res. 562, 149–153] was infused into the medial septal area (0.11–0.42 μg). Hippocampal electrical activity was monitored during trained wheel running, drinking and the paradoxical phase of sleep, as well as following cholinomimetic treatment. A moderate dose of toxin (0.21 μg) eliminated the septohippocampal cholinergic projection, as evidenced by a near total absence of choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive neurons in the medial septum and the vertical limb of the diagonal band, and by the absence of acetylcholinesterase-positive fibers in the dorsal hippocampus. In the same rats, parvalbumin immunoreactivity, a reliable marker for septohippocampal {GABAergic} neurons, [Freund T.F. (1989) Brain Res. 478, 375–381], remained unaltered. In addition, retrograde transport of the tracer fluorogold demonstrated that the parvalbumin cell population preserved its axonal projection to the hippocampus. Following toxin treatment, the power of hippocampal theta, but not its frequency, decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Reduction of theta power occurred between three and seven days after the toxin treatment and remained unaltered thereafter up to eight weeks. A dose which eliminated all septohippocampal cholinergic neurons (0.21 μg) left a small but significant theta peak in the power spectra during wheel running, paradoxical phase of sleep and intraseptal infusion of carbachol (5μg). Peripheral administration of physostigmine (1 mg/kg) induced only slow (1.5–2.0 Hz) rhythmic waves. No changes were observed in the gamma (50–100 Hz) band. These findings indicate that the integrity of the septohippocampal {GABAergic} projection is sufficient to maintain some hippocampal theta activity. We hypothesize that cholinergic neurons serve to increase the population phase-locking of septal cells and thereby regulate the magnitude of hippocampal theta.},

	abstract = {Recent findings indicate that the hippocampus supports not only long-term memory encoding but also plays a role in working memory ({WM}) maintenance of multiple items; however, the neural mechanism underlying multi-item maintenance is still unclear. Theoretical work suggests that multiple items are being maintained by neural assemblies synchronized in the gamma frequency range (25–100 Hz) that are locked to consecutive phase ranges of oscillatory activity in the theta frequency range (4–8 Hz). Indeed, cross-frequency coupling of the amplitude of high-frequency activity to the phase of slower oscillations has been described both in animals and in humans, but has never been linked to a theoretical model of a cognitive process. Here we used intracranial {EEG} recordings in human epilepsy patients to test pivotal predictions from theoretical work. First, we show that simultaneous maintenance of multiple items in {WM} is accompanied by cross-frequency coupling of oscillatory activity in the hippocampus, which is recruited during multi-item {WM}. Second, maintenance of an increasing number of items is associated with modulation of beta/gamma amplitude with theta band activity of lower frequency, consistent with the idea that longer cycles are required for an increased number of representations by gamma cycles. This effect cannot be explained by a difference in theta or beta/gamma power. Third, we describe how the precision of cross-frequency coupling predicts individual {WM} performance. These data support the idea that working memory in humans depends on a neural code using phase information.},

	abstract = {{SYNOPSIS} Place cells are hippocampal neurons whose discharge is strongly related to a rat's location in the environment. The existence of such cells, combined with the reliable impairments seen in spatial tasks after hippocampal damage, has led to the proposal that place cells form part of an integrated neural system dedicated to spatial navigation. This hypothesis is supported by the strong relationships between place cell activity and spatial problem solving, which indicate that the place cell representation must be both functional and in register with the surroundings for the animal to perform correctly in spatial tasks. The place cell system nevertheless requires other essentia) elements to be competent, such as a component that specifies the overall goal of the animal and computes the path required to take the rat from its current location to the goal. Here, we propose a model of the neural network responsible for spatial navigation that includes goal coding and path selection. In this model, the hippocampal formation allows for place recognition, and stores the set of places that can be accessed from each position in the environment. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for encoding goal location and for route planning. The nucleus accumbens translates paths in neural space into appropriate locomotor activity that moves the animal towards the goal in real space. The complete model assumes that the hippocampal output to nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex provides information for generating solutions to spatial problems. In support of this model, we finally present preliminary evidence that the goal representation necessary for path planning might be encoded in the prelimbic/infralimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex.},

We studied the formation of new place representations in rats by examining the changes in place-specific firing of neurons in the {CA}1 region of the hippocampus and the relationship between these changes and behavioral change across multiple days of exposure to novel places. We found that many neurons showed very rapid changes on the first day of exposure to the novel place, including many cases in which a previously silent neuron developed a place field over the course of a single pass through the environment. Across the population, the largest changes in neural activity occurred on day 2 of exposure to a novel place, but only if the animal had little experience ({\textless}4 min) in that location on day 1. Longer exposures on day 1 were associated with smaller changes on day 2, suggesting that hippocampal neurons required 5-6 min of experience to form a stable spatial representation. Even after the representation stabilized, the animals' behavior remained different in the novel places, suggesting that other brain regions continued to distinguish novel from familiar locations. These results show that the hippocampus can form new spatial representations quickly but that stable hippocampal representations are not sufficient for a place to be treated as familiar.},

Afferents to the dentate gyrus and {CA}1 area originate from different cell populations, including projection cells in entorhinal cortex layers two and three, respectively. To determine the organization of oscillatory activities along these terminal fields, we recorded local field potentials from multiple sites in the dentate gyrus and {CA}1 area of the awake mice, and localized gamma frequency (30–150 Hz) oscillations in different layers by means of current source density analysis. During theta oscillations, we observed different temporal and spectral organization of gamma oscillations in the dendritic layers of the dentate gyrus and {CA}1 area, with a sharp transition across the hippocampal fissure. In {CA}1 stratum lacunosum-moleculare, transient mid-frequency gamma oscillations ({CA}1-{gammaM}; 80 Hz) occurred on theta cycle peaks, while in the dentate gyrus, fast ({DG}-{gammaF}; 110 Hz), and slow ({DG}-{gammaS}; 40 Hz) gamma oscillations preferentially occurred on troughs of theta waves. Units in dentate gyrus, in contrast to units in {CA}1 pyramidal layer, phase-coupled to {DG}-{gammaF}, which was largely independent from {CA}1 fast gamma oscillations ({CA}1-{gammaF}) of similar frequency and timing. Spike timing of units recorded in either {CA}1 area or dentate gyrus were modulated by {CA}1-{gammaM}. Our experiments disclosed a set of gamma oscillations that differentially regulate neuronal activity in the dentate gyrus and {CA}1 area, and may allow flexible segregation and integration of information across different levels of hippocampal circuitry.},

This cross-frequency coupling might facilitate neuronal coordination both within and between brain areas. However, it remains unclear whether the phase of theta oscillations controls the power of slow and fast gamma activity or vice versa. We here applied spectral Granger causality, phase slope index and a newly developed cross-frequency directionality ({CFD}) measure to investigate directional interactions between local field potentials recorded within and across hippocampal subregions of {CA}1 and {CA}3 of freely exploring rats. Given the well-known {CA}3 to {CA}1 anatomical connection, we hypothesized that interregional directional interactions were constrained by anatomical connection, and within-frequency and cross-frequency directional interactions were always from {CA}3 to {CA}1. As expected, we found that {CA}3 drove {CA}1 in the theta band, and theta phase-to-gamma power coupling was prominent both within and between {CA}3 and {CA}1 regions. The {CFD} measure further demonstrated that distinct directional couplings with respect to theta phase was different between slow and fast gamma activity. Importantly, {CA}3 slow gamma power phase-adjusted {CA}1 theta oscillations, suggesting that slow gamma activity in {CA}3 entrains theta oscillations in {CA}1. In contrast, {CA}3 theta phase controls {CA}1 fast gamma activity, indicating that communication at {CA}1 fast gamma is coordinated by {CA}3 theta phase. Overall, these findings demonstrate dynamic directional interactions between theta and slow/fast gamma oscillations in the hippocampal network, suggesting that anatomical connections constrain the directional interactions.},

	doi = {10.1037/bne0000366},
	abstract = {Although the activity from the dentate gyrus is known to have strong connections with other hippocampal layers, the functionality of these connections, that is, the degree to which it drives activity in the downstream regions of the hippocampus, is not well understood. This question is particularly relevant for mesoscale localfield potential ({LFP}) rhythms such as gamma oscillations. Following the hypothesis that fundamental features of the {LFP} are consistent with turbulent dynamics, we investigate the crosslayer relationship between the {CA}1 layers and the dentate gyrus as a function of running speed. In agreement with previous studies, same-layer spectral and bispectral analyses show that increasing input (rat speed) results in an increase of power and nonlinearity (phase coupling) between theta and gamma. The effectiveness of the connection between the 2 regions is investigated using cross-bicoherence analysis. Based on the turbulence interpretation of the evolution of spectra and bispectra as a function of the power input rate, we propose a measure for estimating the strength of the cross-frequency, cross-layer nonlinear forcing, that compares the magnitude of bicoherence (same-layer) and cross-bicoherence (cross-layer). Our results suggest that at moderate speeds gamma in {CA}1 is mainly driven by local theta, while the coupling of the {CA}1 gamma to the dentate-gyrus gamma becomes significant. Overall, these data are consistent with the hypothesis of theta-to-gamma energy cascade model for the organization of hippocampal {LFP}, with theta playing the role of a global pacemaker across the entire hippocampus while gamma is a local oscillation generated by through local anatomical connections.

However, little is known about whether and how long-range cross-frequency coupling across distant brain regions subserves working memory. Here we report that theta–slow gamma coupling between the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex ({mPFC}) is augmented in a genetic mouse model of cognitive dysfunction. This increased cross-frequency coupling is observed specifically when the mice successfully perform a spatial working memory task. In wild-type mice, increasing task difficulty by introducing a long delay or by optogenetically interfering with encoding, also increases theta–gamma coupling during correct trials. Finally, epochs of high hippocampal theta–prefrontal slow gamma coupling are associated with increased synchronization of neurons within the {mPFC}. These findings suggest that enhancement of theta–slow gamma coupling reflects a compensatory mechanism to maintain spatial working memory performance in the setting of increased difficulty.},

	abstract = {Electrical extracellular recordings, i.e., recordings of the electrical potentials in the extracellular medium between cells, have been a main work-horse in electrophysiology for almost a century. The high-frequency part of the signal (≳500 Hz), i.e., the multi-unit activity ({MUA}), contains information about the firing of action potentials in surrounding neurons, while the low-frequency part, the local field potential ({LFP}), contains information about how these neurons integrate synaptic inputs. As the recorded extracellular signals arise from multiple neural processes, their interpretation is typically ambiguous and difficult. Fortunately, a precise biophysical modeling scheme linking activity at the cellular level and the recorded signal has been established: the extracellular potential can be calculated as a weighted sum of all transmembrane currents in all cells located in the vicinity of the electrode. This computational scheme can considerably aid the modeling and analysis of {MUA} and {LFP} signals. Here, we describe {LFPy}, an open source Python package for numerical simulations of extracellular potentials. {LFPy} consists of a set of easy-to-use classes for defining cells, synapses and recording electrodes as Python objects, implementing this biophysical modeling scheme. It runs on top of the widely used {NEURON} simulation environment, which allows for flexible usage of both new and existing cell models. Further, calculation of extracellular potentials using the line-source-method is efficiently implemented. We describe the theoretical framework underlying the extracellular potential calculations and illustrate by examples how {LFPy} can be used both for simulating {LFPs}, i.e., synaptic contributions from single cells as well a populations of cells, and {MUAs}, i.e., extracellular signatures of action potentials.},

We estimated the extracellular potentials associated with an action potential in a cortical pyramidal cell using standard one-dimensional cable theory and volume conductor theory. Their spatial and temporal pattern reveal much about the location and timing of currents in the cell, especially in combination with a known morphology, and simple experiments could resolve questions about spike initiation. From the extracellular potential we compute the ephaptically induced polarization in a nearby passive cable. The magnitude of this induced voltage can be several {mV}, does not spread electrotonically, and depends only weakly on the passive properties of the cable.

We address this theoretical ability by developing a model system that captures features of experimentally recorded simultaneous intracellular and extracellular recordings of {CA}1 pyramidal neurons. We use the line source approximation method of Holt and Koch to model the extracellular action potential ({EAP}) voltage resulting from the spiking activity of individual neurons. We compare the simultaneous intracellular and extracellular recordings of {CA}1 pyramidal neurons recorded in vivo with model predictions for the same cells reconstructed and simulated with compartmental models. The model accurately reproduces both the waveform and the amplitude of the {EAPs}, although it was difficult to achieve simultaneous good matches on both the intracellular and extracellular waveforms. This suggests that accounting for the {EAP} waveform provides a considerable constraint on the overall model. The developed model explains how and why the waveform varies with electrode position relative to the recorded cell. Interestingly, each cell's dendritic morphology had very little impact on the {EAP} waveform. The model also demonstrates that the varied composition of ionic currents in different cells is reflected in the features of the {EAP}.},

However, neurophysiological studies in vivo often rather measure the mass activity of neuronal microcircuits with the local field potential ({LFP}). Given that {LFPs} are generated by spatially separated currents across the neuronal membrane, they cannot be computed directly from quantities defined in models of point-like {LIF} neurons. Here, we explore the best approximation for predicting the {LFP} based on standard output from point-neuron {LIF} networks. To search for this best “{LFP} proxy”, we compared {LFP} predictions from candidate proxies based on {LIF} network output (e.g, firing rates, membrane potentials, synaptic currents) with “ground-truth” {LFP} obtained when the {LIF} network synaptic input currents were injected into an analogous three-dimensional (3D) network model of multi-compartmental neurons with realistic morphology, spatial distributions of somata and synapses. We found that a specific fixed linear combination of the {LIF} synaptic currents provided an accurate {LFP} proxy, accounting for most of the variance of the {LFP} time course observed in the 3D network for all recording locations. This proxy performed well over a broad set of conditions, including substantial variations of the neuronal morphologies.

	abstract = {Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples ({SPW}-Rs) support consolidation of recently acquired episodic memories and planning future actions by generating ordered neuronal sequences of previous or future experiences. {SPW}-Rs are characterized by several spectral components: a slow (5-15 Hz) sharp-wave, a high-frequency "ripple" oscillation (150-200 Hz), and a slow "gamma" oscillation (20-40 Hz). Using laminar hippocampal recordings and optogenetic manipulations, we dissected the origin of these spectral components. We show that increased power in the 20-40 Hz band does not reflect an entrainment of {CA}1 and {CA}3 neurons at gamma frequency but the power envelope of overlapping ripples. Spike-local field potential coupling between unit firing in {CA}1 and {CA}3 regions during {SPW}-Rs is lowest in the gamma band. Longer {SPW}-Rs are preceded by increased firing in the entorhinal cortex. Thus, fusion of {SPW}-Rs leads to lengthening of their duration associated with increased power in the slow gamma band without the presence of true oscillation.},

This prediction was never tested, although {DG} place cells remap across similar environments without memory tasks. We confirm this prior finding but find that {DG} place fields do not remap across spatial tasks that require {DG}-dependent memory discrimination. Instead of remapping, place-discriminating discharge is observed transiently amongst {DG} place cells, particularly when memory discrimination is most necessary. The {DG} network may signal memory discrimination by expressing distinctive sub-second network patterns of co-firing at memory discrimination sites. This involves increased coupling of discharge from place cells and interneurons, as was observed during successful but not failed behavioral expression of memory discrimination. Instead of remapping, these findings indicate that memory discrimination is signaled by sub-second patterns of correlated discharge within the dentate network., van Dijk and Fenton report that dentate gyrus place cells signal memory discrimination not by remapping, but by variable sub-second patterns of coordinated place cell discharge marked by enhanced discharge coupling between excitatory and inhibitory neurons during memory discrimination.},

	abstract = {Although hippocampal interneurons typically do not show discrete regions of elevated firing in an environment, such as seen in pyramidal cell place fields, they do exhibit significant spatial modulation ({McNaughton} et al., 1983a). Strong monosynaptic coupling between pyramidal neurons and nearby interneurons in the {CA}1 stratum pyramidale has been strongly implicated on the basis of significant, short-latency peaks in cross-correlogram plots (Csicsvari et al., 1998). Furthermore, interneurons receiving a putative monosynaptic connection from a simultaneously recorded pyramidal cell appear to inherit the spatial modulation of the latter (Marshall et al., 2002). Buzsaki and colleagues hypothesize that interneurons may also adopt the firing phase dynamics of their afferent place cells, which show a phase shift relative to the hippocampal theta rhythm as a rat passes through the place field ("phase precession"). This study confirms and extends the previous reports by showing that interneurons in the dorsal and middle hippocampus with putative monosynaptic connections with place cells recorded on the same tetrode share other properties with their pyramidal cell afferents, including the spatial scale of the place field of pyramidal cell, a characteristic of the septotemporal level of the hippocampus from which the cells are recorded, and the rate of phase precession, which is slower in middle regions. Furthermore, variations in pyramidal cell place field scale within each septotemporal level attributable to task variations are similarly associated with variations in interneuron place field scale. The available data strongly suggest that spatial selectivity of {CA}1 stratum pyramidale interneurons is inherited from a small cluster of local pyramidal cells and is not a consequence of spatially selective synaptic input from {CA}3 or other sources.},

Furthermore, {CA}3 cells with place fields in not-yet-visited arms preferentially fired during {SWRs} at reward locations, and these prospective {CA}3 firing patterns were more pronounced for correct trials and were dentate-dependent.

While {CA}1 pyramidal cells display sharply tuned location-specific firing, the activity of many interneurons show weaker but significant spatial modulation. Although hippocampal interneurons were proposed to participate in the representation of space, their interplay with pyramidal cells in formation of spatial maps is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the spatial correlation between {CA}1 pyramidal cells and putative interneurons recorded concurrently in awake rats. Positively and negatively correlated pairs were found to be simultaneously present in the {CA}1 region. While pyramidal cell–interneuron pairs with positive spatial correlation showed similar firing maps, negative spatial correlation was often accompanied by complementary place maps, which could occur even in the presence of a monosynaptic excitation between the cells. Thus, location-specific firing increase of hippocampal interneurons is not necessarily a simple product of excitation by a pyramidal cell with a similarly positioned firing field. Based on our observation of pyramidal cells firing selectively in the low firing regions of interneurons, we speculate that the location-specific firing of place cells is partly determined by the location-specific decrease of interneuron activity that can release place cells from inhibition.},

One week after injecting toxin into this line, mossy cells throughout the longitudinal axis were degenerated extensively, theta wave power of dentate local field potentials increased during exploration, and deficits occurred in contextual discrimination. By contrast, we detected no epileptiform activity, spontaneous behavioral seizures, or mossy-fiber sprouting 5–6 weeks after mossy cell degeneration.

Granule cells exhibited sparse firing, had a single place field, and showed only modest changes when the mouse was tested in different mazes in the same room. In contrast, mossy cells were more active, had multiple place fields and showed stronger remapping of place fields under the same conditions. Although the granule cell-mossy cell synapse was strong and facilitating, mossy cells rarely “inherited” place fields from single granule cells.

Since the subiculum receives a strong anatomical projection from the hippocampus, it seems possible that the subicular cell spatial patterns are simply driven by the spatial signals from hippocampal place cells. Data presented here, however, suggest that the two areas code space in fundamentally different ways. Here, spatial firing patterns of individual hippocampal and subicular cells were studied as rats navigated in two different environments. The two chambers were a cylinder and a square, of equal area. For some rats the two chambers were painted to have similar visual stimulus characteristics, while for others, the two were very different. The subicular cells showed very similar firing patterns in the two chambers, regardless of whether they were visually similar or different. In contrast, as predicted based on the findings of earlier studies, hippocampal place cells showed different patterns in the two (again, regardless of their visual similarity). These results suggest that the subicular cells have the ability to transfer a single, abstract spatial representation from one environment to another. This pattern is stretched to fit within the boundaries of the current environment. Thus, the subicular cells seem to provide a generic representation of the geometric relationships between different locations in an environment. It seems possible that this representation may contribute to some navigational abilities exhibited by animals, such as dead reckoning, and novel route generation in unfamiliar environments. In contrast, it appears that hippocampal place cells provide a spatial representation which is unique for each environment and which is strongly influenced by the exact details and overall context of the situation.},

	abstract = {Place cells are hippocampal neurons that have a strong location-specific firing activity in the rat's current environment. Collectively, place cells also provide a signature of the rat's environment as their ensemble activity is markedly different when recorded in distinct apparatuses. This phenomenon, referred to as ‘remapping’, suggests that each environment activates a different hippocampal map. In this study, we sought to determine the independence of such maps. In Experiment 1, we used a cylinder apparatus that was divided into two equal halves by a central barrier with an aperture allowing the rat to freely commute between the two sides. A local change in one side failed to induce field remapping in the changed side, thus precluding any significant conclusion to be drawn. We therefore designed Experiment 2 in which place cells were first recorded while rats explored three distinct high-walled boxes. Most cells had distinctive firing fields in each box. A runway was then added to connect two initially unrelated boxes. This manipulation altered the firing of some cells but the fields in each box were still clearly distinguishable. The final manipulation consisted of changing one box and allowing the rat to commute freely between the changed and unchanged boxes. While the firing fields remapped in the changed box, they were most usually unaltered in the unchanged box. These results suggest that the hippocampus holds a set of independent maps for each box, and that each specific map is activated mainly according to the rat's current sensory environment.},

	abstract = {Episodic-like memory is thought to be supported by attractor dynamics in the hippocampus. A possible neural substrate for this memory mechanism is rate remapping, in which the spatial map of place cells encodes contextual information through firing rate variability. To test whether memories are stored as multimodal attractors in populations of place cells, recent experiments morphed one familiar context into another while observing the responses of {CA}3 cell ensembles. Average population activity in {CA}3 was reported to transition gradually rather than abruptly from one familiar context to the next, suggesting a lack of attractive forces associated with the two stored representations. On the other hand, individual {CA}3 cells showed a mix of gradual and abrupt transitions at different points along the morph sequence, and some displayed hysteresis which is a signature of attractor dynamics. To understand whether these seemingly conflicting results are commensurate with attractor network theory, we developed a neural network model of the {CA}3 with attractors for both position and discrete contexts. We found that for memories stored in overlapping neural ensembles within a single spatial map, position-dependent context attractors made transitions at different points along the morph sequence. Smooth transition curves arose from averaging across the population, while a heterogeneous set of responses was observed on the single unit level. In contrast, orthogonal memories led to abrupt and coherent transitions on both population and single unit levels as experimentally observed when remapping between two independent spatial maps. Strong recurrent feedback entailed a hysteretic effect on the network which diminished with the amount of overlap in the stored memories. These results suggest that context-dependent memory can be supported by overlapping local attractors within a spatial map of {CA}3 place cells. Similar mechanisms for context-dependent memory may also be found in other regions of the cerebral cortex.},

However, such states have not been directly observed. For example, the hippocampal place cell representation of location was previously found to respond continuously to changes in environmental shape alone. We report that exposure to novel square and circular environments made of different materials creates attractor representations for both shapes: Place cells abruptly and simultaneously switch between representations as environmental shape changes incrementally. This enables study of attractor dynamics in a cognitive representation and may correspond to the formation of distinct contexts in context-dependent memory.

(2) The origin of journeys influenced firing even when rats made detours, showing that recent memory could modulate neuronal activity more than spatial trajectory.

How these computations are segregated or integrated, depending on the cognitive needs, is not fully understood. Although theta activity in the hippocampus is most commonly studied as a unique coherent oscillation, it is the result of a complex interaction between different rhythm generators. Here we investigated the coordination between theta generators as a possible mechanism to couple or decouple internally and externally driven computations. We separated and quantified three different theta current generators from the hippocampus of freely behaving rats, one originating in {CA}3 with current sinks in {CA}1 \textit{str. radiatum} and two with current sinks in {CA}1 \textit{str. lacunosum-moleculare} and dentate molecular layer, mainly driven by entorhinal cortex ({EC}) layers 3 and 2, respectively. These theta generators followed non fully coherent dynamics and presented epochs of higher and lower phase coupling, suggesting a flexible interaction between them. Selective optogenetic inhibition in {CA}3 depressed the \textit{str. radiatum} generator without affecting the {EC}-driven theta oscillations, indicating that theta rhythm generators can be modulated independently. In addition, band-specific gamma interactions with theta oscillations selectively occurred with the corresponding pathway-specific theta current generator, supporting the existence of different theta-gamma coding frameworks to organize neuronal firing in the hippocampus. Importantly, we found that epochs of highly synchronized theta rhythmicity across generators preferentially occurred during memory-guided exploration and mismatch novelty detection in familiar environments, two conditions in which internally generated memory representations need to be coordinated with the incoming sensory information about external cues. We propose a mechanism for segregating and integrating hippocampal computations based on the coexistence of different theta-gamma frameworks that flexibly couple or decouple accommodating the cognitive needs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Experiments in rats tasked to track down their food in changing environments now reveal two distinct codes for memory representation in the hippocampus.

Of 36 {PV}-{IR} cells, 29 were basket cells, with most of their axonal arbours in the stratum pyramidale ({SP}). Six were bistratified cells with axons ramifying throughout stratum oriens ({SO}) and stratum radiatum ({SR}). One was a putative axo-axonic cell with an axonal arbour confined to half of the {SP} and a narrow adjacent region of the {SO}. Of 27 {CCK}-{IR} neurones, 13 were basket cells, with most of their axonal arbours in the {SP}, and included basket cells with somata in the {SP} (6), {SO} (3), and {SR} (2) and at the border between the stratum lacunosum-moleculare ({SLM}) and the {SR} (2). In addition, several dendrite-targeting cell classes expressed {CCK}-{IR}: 4 of 9 bistratified cells with axons ramifying in the {SO} and {SR}; all five Schaffer-associated cells whose axons ramified extensively in the {SR}; both cells classified as quadrilaminar because their axons ramified in the {SO}, {SP}, {SR}, and {SLM}; one {SO}-{SO} cell whose dendritic and axonal arbours were contained within the {SO}; and one perforant path-associated cell with axonal and dendritic arbours within the distal {SR} and {SLM}. The majority (31 of 36) of {PV}-{IR} neurones recorded were fast-spiking, and most fast-spiking cells tested (25 of 29 basket, 1 axo-axonic, and 5 of 6 bistratified cells) were {PV}-{IR}. However, 1 of 6 regular-spiking basket, 1 of 4 regular-spiking bistratified, and 3 of 5 burst-firing basket cells were also {PV}-{IR}. In contrast, the majority (17 of 27) of the {CCK}-{IR} neurones recorded were regular-spiking, 3 were burst-firing, and 7 were fast-spiking. These data confirm that the majority of {PV}-{IR} and {CCK}-{IR} axon terminals innervate proximal portions of {CA}1 pyramidal cells. Most {PV}-{IR} cells are fast-spiking, whereas most {CCK}-{IR} cells are regular-spiking. In both neurochemical classes basket cells predominate, but both groups included subpopulations of dendrite-targeting cells. Despite these similarities, the two populations exhibited very different somatic distributions, and each contained cellular morphologies not represented in the other. J. Comp.

	abstract = {In adult rat hippocampus, simultaneous intracellular recordings from 989 pairs of {CA}1 pyramidal cells revealed nine monosynaptic, excitatory connections. Six of these pairs were sufficiently stable for electrophysiological analysis. Mean excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude recorded at a postsynaptic membrane potential between −67 and −70 {mV} was 0.7 ± 0.5 {mV} (0.17–1.5 {mV}), mean 10–90\% rise time was 2.7 ± 0.9 ms (1.5–3.8 ms) and mean width at half-amplitude was 16.8 ± 4.1 ms (11.6-25 ms). Cells were labelled with biocytin and identified histologically. For one pair that was fully reconstructed morphologically, excitatory postsynaptic potential average amplitude was 1.5 {mV}, 10–90\% rise time 2.8 ms and width at half-amplitude 11.6 ms (at -67 {mV}). In this pair, correlated light and electron microscopy revealed that the presynaptic axon formed two synaptic contacts with third-order basal dendrites of the postsynaptic pyramid, one with a dendritic spine, the other with a dendritic shaft. In the four pairs tested, postsynaptic depolarization increased excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude and duration. In two, D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (50 μM) reduced the amplitude and duration of the excitatory postsynaptic potential. The remainder of the excitatory postsynaptic potential now increased with postsynaptic hyperpolarization and was abolished by 20 μM 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (n = 1). Paired-pulse depression was evident in the four excitatory postsynaptic potentials tested. This depression decreased with increasing inter-spike interval. These results provide the first combined electrophysiological and morphological illustration of synaptic contacts between pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus and confirm that connections between {CA}1 pyramidal neurons are mediated by both N-methyl-d-aspartate and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate/kainate receptors.},

Border cells are relatively sparse, making up less than 10\% of the local cell population, but can be found in all layers of the medial entorhinal cortex as well as the adjacent parasubiculum, often intermingled with head-direction cells and grid cells. Border cells may be instrumental in planning trajectories and anchoring grid fields and place fields to a geometric reference frame.},

In this study we investigated the effects of prenatal nicotine exposure ({NIC}), postnatal maternal deprivation ({MD}) or the combination of the two ({NIC}+{MD}) to determine if hippocampal neuron development is modulated by exposure to drugs of abuse and/or stress. Growth of rat offspring exposed to {MD} alone or {NIC}+{MD} was repressed until after weaning. In {CA}1 but not {CA}3 of postnatal day 14 (P14) pups, {MD} increased pyramidal neurons, however, in dentate gyrus ({DG}), decreased granule neurons. {NIC} had no effect on neuron number in {CA}1, {CA}3 or {DG}. Unexpectedly, {NIC} plus {MD} combined caused a synergistic increase in the number of {CA}1 or {CA}3 neurons. Neuron density in {CA} regions was unaffected by treatment, but in the {DG}, granule neurons had a looser packing density after {NIC}, {MD} or {NIC}+{MD} exposure. When septotemporal axes were analyzed, the synergism of stress and drug exposure in {CA}1 and {CA}3 was associated with rostral, whereas {MD} effects were predominantly associated with caudal neurons. {TUNEL} labeling suggests no active apoptosis at P14, and doublecortin positive neurons and mossy fibers were diminished in {NIC}+{MD} relative to controls. The laterality of the effect of nicotine and/or maternal deprivation in right versus left hippocampus was also analyzed and found to be insiginificant. We report for the first time that early life stressors such as postnatal {MD} and prenatal {NIC} exposure, when combined, may exhibit synergistic consequences for {CA}1 and {CA}3 pyramidal neuron development, and a potential antagonistic influence on developing {DG} neurons. These results suggest that early stressors may modulate neurogenesis, apoptosis, or maturation of glutamatergic neurons in the hippocampus in a region-specific manner during critical periods of neurodevelopment.},

We measured variations in neuronal excitability, subthreshold membrane properties and neurotransmitter responses along the longitudinal axis. We found that (i) pyramidal cells of the dorsal hippocampus ({DH}) were less excitable than those of the ventral hippocampus ({VH}). Resting Membrane Potential ({RMP}) was more hyperpolarized and somatic Input Resistance (Ri) was lower in {DH} compared to {VH}. (ii) The Paired-pulse ratio ({PPR}) of focally induced synaptic responses was systematically reduced from the {DH} to the {VH}; (iii) Long-term-potentiation was most pronounced in the {DH} and fell gradually in the intermediate hippocampus and in the {VH}; (iv) the frequency of miniature {GABAergic} events was higher in the {VH} than in the {DH}; (v) the {PPR} of evoked inhibitory post-synaptic current ({IPSC}) was higher in the {DH} than in the {VH}.

However, the mechanism of how such associations may be learned and used is currently unknown. We recorded neural ensembles and local field potentials from the ventral striatum and {CA}1 simultaneously as rats ran a modified T-maze. Theta-modulated cells in ventral striatum almost invariably showed firing phase precession relative to the hippocampal theta rhythm. Across the population of ventral striatal cells, phase precession was preferentially associated with an anticipatory ramping of activity up to the reward sites. In contrast, {CA}1 population activity and phase precession were distributed more uniformly. Ventral striatal phase precession was stronger to hippocampal than ventral striatal theta and was accompanied by increased theta coherence with hippocampus, suggesting that this effect is hippocampally derived. These results suggest that the firing phase of ventral striatal neurons contains motivationally relevant information and that phase precession serves to bind hippocampal place representations to ventral striatal representations of reward.},

“cognitive map” is utilized by other brain regions to guide
behavior remains unexplored. To examine how neuronal firing patterns in the
hippocampus are transmitted and transformed, we recorded neurons in its
principal subcortical target, the lateral septum ({LS}). We observed that {LS}
neurons carry reliable spatial information in the phase of action potentials,
relative to hippocampal theta oscillations, while the firing rates of {LS} neurons
remained uninformative. Furthermore, this spatial phase code had an anatomical
microstructure within the {LS} and was bound to the hippocampal spatial code by
synchronous gamma frequency cell assemblies. Using a data-driven model, we show
that rate-independent spatial tuning arises through the dynamic weighting of {CA}1
and {CA}3 cell assemblies. Our findings demonstrate that transformation of the
hippocampal spatial map depends on higher-order theta-dependent neuronal
sequences., How abstract representations are translated into action is unknown.
Tingley and Buzsá ki describe how the hippocampal cognitive map is
“read out” by a target region. The transformation relies on
population coordination referenced to theta oscillations rather than the tuning
of individual neurons.},

However, this requires the rate and phase to vary independently, in contrast to recent suggestions5,6 that they are tightly coupled, both reflecting the amplitude of the cell's input. Here we show that the time of firing and firing rate are dissociable, and can represent two independent variables: respectively the animal's location within the place field, and its speed of movement through the field. Independent encoding of location together with actions and stimuli occurring there may help to explain the dual roles of the hippocampus in spatial and episodic memory7,8, or may indicate a more general role of the hippocampus in relational/declarative memory9,10.},

Low-frequency pairing of excitatory postsynaptic potentials ({EPSPs}) and action potentials ({APs}) induces long-term potentiation ({LTP}), independent of temporal order. The {STDP} curve is symmetric and broad (half-width ∼150 ms). Consistent with these {STDP} induction properties, {AP}–{EPSP} sequences lead to supralinear summation of spine [Ca2+] transients. Furthermore, afterdepolarizations ({ADPs}) following {APs} efficiently propagate into dendrites of {CA}3 pyramidal neurons, and {EPSPs} summate with dendritic {ADPs}. In autoassociative network models, storage and recall are more robust with symmetric than with asymmetric {STDP} rules.

	abstract = {Hippocampal non-principal neurons at the stratum radiatum-stratum lacunosum-moleculare border (R-{LM} interneurons) of the {CA}1 area may constitute several cell classes and have been implicated in the generation of {GABAergic} unitary {IPSPs}. Using biocytin-filled electrodes we recorded R-{LM} interneurons intracellularly in vitro and determined their postsynaptic effects in concomitantly recorded pyramidal cells.
            
            
              Light microscopic analysis revealed four populations of R-{LM} interneurons with distinct axons: (1) basket cells (n= 4) with axons predominantly ramifying in the pyramidal cell layer; (2) Schaffer collateral/commissural pathway-associated interneurons (n= 10) stratifying in stratum radiatum and, to a lesser extent, stratum oriens; (3) perforant pathway-associated interneurons (n= 6) innervating the perforant path termination zone in stratum lacunosum-moleculare of the {CA}1 area as well as equivalent portions of the dentate gyrus and subiculum; and (4) neurogliaform interneurons (n= 2) characterized by their dense, compact axonal and dendritic arbour.
            
            
              Random electron microscopic sampling of synaptic targets revealed a preponderance of pyramidal neurons as postsynaptic elements. Basket cells had a synaptic target preference for somata and proximal dendrites, whereas the remainder of R-{LM} interneurons innervated dendritic shafts and spines. The axon of dendrite-targeting cells formed up to six putative contacts with individual postsynaptic pyramidal cells.
            
            
              Anatomically recovered R-{LM} interneurons (n= 22) had a mean resting membrane potential of -56.7 ± 3.6 {mV}, a membrane time constant of 12.9 ± 7.7 ms and an input resistance of 86.4 ± 29.2 {MΩ}. Depolarizing current pulses generally elicited overshooting action potentials (70.8 ± 6.9 {mV}) which had a mean duration, when measured at half-amplitude, of 0.7 ± 0.1 ms. In response to prolonged ({\textgreater} 200 ms) depolarizing current pulses all R-{LM} interneurons displayed (a varying degree of) spike frequency adaptation.
            
            
              Basket cells, Schaffer-associated and neurogliaform interneurons elicited small-amplitude ({\textless} 2 {mV}), short-latency {IPSPs} in postsynaptic pyramids (n= 5, 13 and 1, respectively). Those interactions in which an effect was elicited with the repetitive activation of the presynaptic neuron (n= 13) showed a substantial degree of postsynaptic response summation. Unitary {IPSPs} had fast kinetics and, whenever tested (n= 5; 1 basket cell and 4 Schaffer-associated interneurons), were abolished by the {GABAA} receptor antagonist bicuculline.
            
            
              Thus, R-{LM} interneurons comprise several distinct populations which evoke fast {GABAA} receptor-mediated {IPSPs}. The domain-specific innervation of postsynaptic pyramidal cells suggests functionally diverse effects on the integration of afferent information in functionally non-equivalent compartments of pyramidal cells.},

	abstract = {Feedforward inhibition of neurons is a fundamental component of information flow control in the brain. We studied the roles played by neurogliaform cells ({NGFCs}) of stratum lacunosum moleculare of the hippocampus in providing feedforward inhibition to {CA}1 pyramidal cells. We recorded from synaptically coupled pairs of anatomically identified {NGFCs} and {CA}1 pyramidal cells and found that, strikingly, a single presynaptic action potential evoked a biphasic unitary {IPSC} ({uIPSC}), consisting of two distinct components mediated by {GABAA} and {GABAB} receptors. A {GABAB} receptor-mediated unitary response has not previously been observed in hippocampal excitatory neurons. The decay of the {GABAA} receptor-mediated response was slow (time constant = 50 ms), and was tightly regulated by presynaptic {GABAB} receptors. Surprisingly, the {GABAB} receptor ligands baclofen and (2S)-3-\{[(1S)-1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]amino-2-hydroxypropyl\}(phenylmethyl)phosphinic acid ({CGP}55845), while affecting the {NGFC}-mediated {uIPSCs}, had no effect on action potential-evoked presynaptic Ca2+ signals monitored in individual axonal boutons of {NGFCs} with two-photon microscopy. In contrast, baclofen clearly depressed presynaptic Ca2+ transients in non-{NGF} interneurons. Changes in extracellular Ca2+ concentration that mimicked the effects of baclofen or {CGP}55845 on {uIPSCs} significantly altered presynaptic Ca2+ transients. Electrophysiological data suggest that {GABAB} receptors expressed by {NGFCs} contribute to the dynamic control of the excitatory input to {CA}1 pyramidal neurons from the temporoammonic path. The {NGFC}–{CA}1 pyramidal cell connection therefore provides a unique and subtle mechanism to shape the integration time domain for signals arriving via a major excitatory input to {CA}1 pyramidal cells.},

	abstract = {Dual intracellular recordings in the {CA}1 region of adult rat hippocampal slices and biocytin filling of synaptically connected cells were used to study the excitatory postsynaptic potentials ({EPSPs}) elicited in basket (n= 7) and bistratified interneurones (n= 7) by action potentials activated in simultaneously recorded pyramidal cells.
            
            
              Interneurones could be subdivided according to their electrophysiological properties into classical fast spiking, burst firing, regular spiking and fast spiking cells with a rounded spike after-hyperpolarization. These physiological classes did not, however, correlate with morphological type. {EPSPs} were not recorded in regular spiking cells.
            
            
              Average {EPSP} amplitudes were larger in bistratified cells (range, 0.5–9 {mV}) than in basket cells (range, 0.15–3.6 {mV}) and the probability of obtaining a pyramidal cell-interneurone {EPSP} was also higher for the bistratified cells (1:7) than for the basket cells (1:22). {EPSP} 10–90\% rise times in bistratified cells (0.7–2 ms) and their widths at half-amplitude (3.9–11.2 ms) were slightly longer than in basket cells (rise times, 0.4–1.6 ms; half-widths, 2.2–9.7 ms).
            
            
              The majority of these {EPSPs} (6 of 8 tested) increased in amplitude and duration with postsynaptic depolarization, although in two (of 4) basket cells the voltage relation was conventional.
            
            
              All {EPSPs} tested in both basket (n= 7) and bistratified cells (n= 5) decreased in amplitude with repetitive presynaptic firing. The average amplitudes of second {EPSPs} elicited within 15 ms of the first were between 34 and 94\% of the average amplitude of the first {EPSP}. Third and fourth {EPSPs} in brief trains were further depressed. This depression was associated with an increase in the incidence of apparent failures of transmission indicating a presynaptic locus.},

	abstract = {In the cerebral cortex, {GABAergic} interneurons are often regarded as fast-spiking cells. We have identified a type of slow-spiking interneuron that offers distinct contributions to network activity. “Ivy” cells, named after their dense and fine axons innervating mostly basal and oblique pyramidal cell dendrites, are more numerous than the parvalbumin-expressing basket, bistratified, or axo-axonic cells. Ivy cells express nitric oxide synthase, neuropeptide Y, and high levels of {GABAA} receptor α1 subunit; they discharge at a low frequency with wide spikes in vivo, yet are distinctively phase-locked to behaviorally relevant network rhythms including theta, gamma, and ripple oscillations. Paired recordings in vitro showed that Ivy cells receive depressing {EPSPs} from pyramidal cells, which in turn receive slowly rising and decaying inhibitory input from Ivy cells. In contrast to fast-spiking interneurons operating with millisecond precision, the highly abundant Ivy cells express presynaptically acting neuromodulators and regulate the excitability of pyramidal cell dendrites through slowly rising and decaying {GABAergic} inputs.},

	abstract = {The morphological properties and connectivity of γ-aminobutyric acid ({GABA})ergic hippocampal cells projecting to the medial septum ({HS} cells) were examined in the rat. Two types of {HS} cells are located in different layers of the hippocampus: sparsely-spiny cells are in {CA}1–3 str. oriens and {CA}3 str. radiatum, where recurrent axons of pyramidal cells arborize. Densely-spiny {HS} cells with spiny somata are located in the termination zone of granule cell axons. In the hilus, intermediate morphologies can also be found. {HS} cells receive {GABAergic} medial septal afferents in all layers where they occur, thus the connectivity of the septum and the hippocampus is reciprocal at cell level. {HS} cells receive extremely dense innervation, sparsely-spiny cells are innervated by ∼19 000 excitatory inputs, while densely-spiny cells get an even larger number (∼37 000). While 14\% of the inputs are inhibitory for the sparsely-spiny cells, it is only 2.3\% in the case of densely-spiny cells. Because a high proportion (up to 54.5\% on somata and 27.5\% on dendrites) of their {GABAergic} inputs derived from labelled septal terminals, their predominant inhibitory input probably arises from the medial septum. {CA}1 area {HS} cells possessed myelinated projecting axons, as well as local collaterals, which targeted mostly pyramidal cell dendrites and spines in str. oriens and radiatum. The synaptic organization suggests that by sampling the activity of large populations of principal cells {HS} cells can reliably broadcast hippocampal activity level to the medial septum.},

	abstract = {The two main glutamatergic pathways to the {CA}1 area, the Schaffer collateral/commissural input and the entorhinal fibers, as well as the local axons of {CA}1 pyramidal cells innervate both pyramidal cells and interneurons. To determine whether these inputs differ in their weights of activating {GABAergic} circuits, we have studied the relative proportion of pyramidal cells and interneurons among their postsynaptic targets in serial electron microscopic sections. Local axons of {CA}1 pyramidal cells, intracellularly labeled in vitro or in vivo, innervated a relatively high proportion of interneuronal postsynaptic targets (65.9 and 53.8\%, in vitro and in vivo, respectively) in stratum (str.) oriens and alveus. In contrast, axons of in vitro labeled {CA}3 pyramidal cells in str. oriens and str. radiatum of the {CA}1 area made synaptic junctions predominantly with pyramidal cell spines (92.9\%). The postsynaptic targets of anterogradely labeled medial entorhinal cortical boutons in {CA}1 str. lacunosum-moleculare were primarily pyramidal neuron dendritic spines and shafts (90.8\%). The alvear group of the entorhinal afferents, traversing str. oriens, str. pyramidale, and str. radiatum showed a higher preference for innervating {GABAergic} cells (21.3\%), particularly in str. oriens/alveus. These data demonstrate that different glutamatergic pathways innervate {CA}1 {GABAergic} cells to different extents. The results suggest that the numerically smaller {CA}1 local axonal inputs together with the alvear part of the entorhinal input preferentially act on {GABAergic} interneurons in contrast to the {CA}3, or the entorhinal input in str. lacunosum-moleculare. The results highlight differences in the postsynaptic target selection of the feed-forward versus recurrent glutamatergic inputs to the {CA}1 and {CA}3 areas.},

	abstract = {Inhibitory postsynaptic currents ({IPSCs}) evoked in {CA}1 pyramidal cells (n = 46) by identified interneurones (n = 43) located in str. oriens were recorded in order to compare their functional properties and to determine the effect of synapse location on the apparent {IPSC} kinetics as recorded using somatic voltage clamp at −70 {mV} and nearly symmetrical [Cl−].
            
            
              Five types of visualised presynaptic interneurone, oriens-lacunosum moleculare (O-{LMC}), basket ({BC}), axo-axonic ({AAC}), bistratified ({BiC}) and oriens-bistratified (O-{BiC}) cells, were distinguished by immunocytochemistry and/or synapse location using light and electron microscopy.
            
            
              Somatostatin immunoreactive O-{LMCs}, innervating the most distal dendritic shafts and spines, evoked the smallest amplitude (26 ± 10 {pA}, s.e.m., n = 8) and slowest {IPSCs} (10–90 \% rise time, 6.2 ± 0.6 ms; decay, 20.8 ± 1.7 ms, n = 8), with no paired-pulse modulation of the second {IPSC} (93 ± 4 \%) at 100 ms interspike interval. In contrast, parvalbumin-positive {AACs} evoked larger amplitude (308 ± 103 {pA}, n = 7) and kinetically faster (rise time, 0.8 ± 0.1 ms; decay 11.2 ± 0.9 ms, n = 7) {IPSCs} showing paired-pulse depression (to 68 ± 5 \%, n = 6). Parvalbumin- or {CCK}-positive {BCs} (n = 9) terminating on soma/dendrites, {BiCs} (n = 4) and O-{BiCs} (n = 7) innervating dendrites evoked {IPSCs} with intermediate kinetic parameters. The properties of {IPSCs} and sensitivity to bicuculline indicated that they were mediated by {GABAA} receptors.
            
            
              In three cases, kinetically complex, multiphasic {IPSCs}, evoked by an action potential in the recorded basket cells, suggested that coupled interneurones, possibly through electrotonic junctions, converged on the same postsynaptic neurone.
            
            
              The population of O-{BiCs} (4 of 4 somatostatin positive) characterised in this study had horizontal dendrites restricted to str. oriens/alveus and innervated stratum radiatum and oriens. Other {BiCs} had radial dendrites as described earlier. The parameters of {IPSCs} evoked by {BiCs} and O-{BiCs} showed the largest cell to cell variation, and a single interneurone could evoke both small and slow as well as large and relatively fast {IPSCs}.
            
            
              The kinetic properties of the somatically recorded postsynaptic current are correlated with the innervated cell surface domain. A significant correlation of rise and decay times for the overall population of unitary {IPSCs} suggests that electrotonic filtering of distal responses is a major factor for the location and cell type specific differences of unitary {IPSCs}, but molecular heterogeneity of postsynaptic {GABAA} receptors may also contribute to the observed kinetic differences. Furthermore, domain specific differences in the short-term plasticity of the postsynaptic response indicate a differentiation of interneurones in activity-dependent responses.},

	abstract = {1. The properties of a well-defined type of {GABAergic} local circuit neuron, the axo-axonic cell (n = 17), were investigated in rat hippocampal slice preparations. During intracellular recording we injected axo-axonic cells with biocytin and subsequently identified them with correlated light and electron microscopy. Employing an immunogold-silver intensification technique we showed that one of the physiologically characterized cells was immunoreactive for gamma-aminobutyric acid ({GABA}). 2. Axo-axonic cells were encountered in the dentate gyrus (n = 5) as well as subfields {CA}3 (n = 2) and {CA}1 (n = 10). They generally had smooth, beaded dendrites that extended throughout all hippocampal layers. Their axons ramified densely in the cell body layers and in the subjacent stratum oriens or hilus, respectively. Tested with electron microscopy, labeled terminals (n = 53) established synapses exclusively with the axon initial segment of principal cells in strata oriens and pyramidale and rarely in lower radiatum. Within a 400-microns slice a single {CA}1 axo-axonic cell was estimated to be in synaptic contact with 686 pyramidal cells. 3. Axo-axonic cells (n = 14) had a mean resting membrane potential of -65.1 {mV}, an average input resistance of 73.9 M omega, and a mean time constant of 7.7 ms. Action potentials were of short duration (389-microseconds width at half-amplitude) and had a mean amplitude of 64.1 {mV}. 4. Nine of 10 tested cells showed a varying degree of spike frequency adaptation in response to depolarizing current injection. Current-evoked action potentials were usually curtailed by a deep (10.2 {mV}) short-latency afterhyperpolarization ({AHP}) with a mean duration of 28.1 ms. 5. Cells with strong spike frequency accommodation (n = 5) had a characteristic firing pattern with numerous spike doublets. These appeared to be triggered by an underlying depolarizing afterpotential. In the same cells, prolonged bursts of action potentials were followed by a prominent long-duration {AHP} with a mean time constant of 1.15 s. 6. Axo-axonic cells responded to the stimulation of afferent pathways with short-latency excitatory postsynaptic potentials ({EPSPs}) or at higher stimulation intensity with up to three action potentials. Axo-axonic cells in the dentate gyrus could be activated by stimulating the {CA}3 area as well as the perforant path, whereas in the {CA}1 area responses were elicited after shocks to the perforant path, Schaffer collaterals, and the stratum oriens-alveus border. 7. In the {CA}1 area the {EPSP} amplitude increased in response to membrane hyperpolarization.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

Here we report that, in rats repeatedly exposed to two differently shaped environments, the hippocampal-place-cell representations of those environments gradually and incrementally diverge; this divergence is specific to environmental shape, occurs independently of explicit reward, persists for periods of at least one month, and transfers to new enclosures of the same shape. These results indicate that place cells may be a neural substrate for long-term incidental learning, and demonstrate the long-term stability of an experience-dependent firing pattern in the hippocampal formation.},

While the neural mechanisms that underlie these processes are only partially understood, a series of recent papers point to awake memory replay as a potential contributor to both consolidation and retrieval. Replay is the sequential reactivation of hippocampal place cells that represent previously experienced behavioral trajectories and occurs frequently in the awake state, particularly during periods of relative immobility. Awake replay may reflect trajectories through either the current environment or previously visited environments that are spatially remote. The repetition of learned sequences on a compressed time scale is well suited to promote memory consolidation in distributed circuits beyond the hippocampus, suggesting that consolidation occurs in both the awake and sleeping animal. Moreover, sensory information can influence the content of awake replay, suggesting a role for awake replay in memory retrieval.},

More than any other hippocampal subfield, area {CA}1 displayed responses consistent with a match/mismatch detector. Specifically, the responses in area {CA}1 tracked the total number of changes present in the probe. Additionally, area {CA}1 was sensitive to both behaviorally relevant and irrelevant changes, a key feature of an automatic comparator.

	abstract = {Magnetoencephalography ({MEG}) is used in clinical and fundamental studies of brain functions, primarily for the excellent temporal resolution it provides. The spatial resolution is often assumed to be poor, because of the ill-posed nature of {MEG} source modeling. However, the question of spatial resolution in {MEG} has seldom been studied in quantitative detail. Here we use the well-known retinotopic organization of the primary visual cortex (V1) as a benchmark for estimating the spatial resolution of {MEG} source imaging. Using a standard visual stimulation paradigm in human subjects, we find that individual {MEG} sources exhibit well-delineated visual receptive fields that collectively follow the known mapping of the retinal surface onto the cortex. Based on the size of these receptive fields and the variability of the signal, we are able to resolve {MEG} signals separated by approximately 7 mm in smooth regions of cortex and less than 1 mm for signals near curved gyri. The maximum resolution is thus comparable to that of the spacing of hypercolumns in human visual cortex. Overall, our results suggest that the spatial resolution of {MEG} can approach or in some cases exceed that of {fMRI}.},

However, the precise organization of these functional maps as well as their interrelationships remain unsettled. Here, we show that spatial frequency representation in cat early visual cortex exhibits singularities around which the map organizes like an electric dipole potential. These singularities are precisely co-located with singularities of the orientation map: the pinwheel centers. To show this, we used high resolution intrinsic optical imaging in cat areas 17 and 18. First, we show that a majority of pinwheel centers exhibit in their neighborhood both semi-global maximum and minimum in the spatial frequency map (i.e. extreme values of the spatial frequency in a hypercolumn). This contradicts pioneering studies suggesting that pinwheel centers are placed at the locus of a single spatial frequency extremum. Based on an analogy with electromagnetism, we proposed a mathematical model for a dipolar structure, accurately fitting optical imaging data. We conclude that a majority of orientation pinwheel centers form spatial frequency dipoles in cat early visual cortex. Given the functional specificities of neurons at singularities in the visual cortex, it is argued that the dipolar organization of spatial frequency around pinwheel centers could be fundamental for visual processing.},

However, to date, the relationship of orientation architecture to the encoding of multiple elemental aspects of visual contours is still unknown.

	abstract = {A theory is presented of the way in which the hypercolumns in primary visual cortex (V1) are organized to detect important features of visual images, namely local orientation and spatial-frequency. Given the existence in V1 of dual maps for these features, both organized around orientation pinwheels, we constructed a model of a hypercolumn in which orientation and spatial-frequency preferences are represented by the two angular coordinates of a sphere. The two poles of this sphere are taken to correspond, respectively, to high and low spatial-frequency preferences. In Part I of the paper, we use mean-field methods to derive exact solutions for localized activity states on the sphere. We show how cortical amplification through recurrent interactions generates a sharply tuned, contrast-invariant population response to both local orientation and local spatial frequency, even in the case of a weakly biased input from the lateral geniculate nucleus ({LGN}). A major prediction of our model is that this response is non-separable with respect to the local orientation and spatial frequency of a stimulus. That is, orientation tuning is weaker around the pinwheels, and there is a shift in spatial-frequency tuning towards that of the closest pinwheel at non-optimal orientations. In Part {II} of the paper, we demonstrate that a simple feed-forward model of spatial-frequency preference, unlike that for orientation preference, does not generate a faithful representation when amplified by recurrent interactions in V1. We then introduce the idea that cortico-geniculate feedback modulates {LGN} activity to generate a faithful representation, thus providing a new functional interpretation of the role of this feedback pathway. Using linear filter theory, we show that if the feedback from a cortical cell is taken to be approximately equal to the reciprocal of the corresponding feed-forward receptive field (in the two-dimensional Fourier domain), then the mismatch between the feed-forward and cortical frequency representations is eliminated. We therefore predict that cortico-geniculate feedback connections innervate the {LGN} in a pattern determined by the orientation and spatial-frequency biases of feed-forward receptive fields. Finally, we show how recurrent cortical interactions can generate cross-orientation suppression.},

This fundamental concept laid the groundwork for the notion of a modular sensory cortex, canonical cortical circuits and an understanding of visual field coverage beyond simple retinotopy. Surprisingly, the search for and description of analogous hypercolumnar organizations in other cortical areas to date has been limited. In the present work, we have applied the hypercolumn concept to the functional organization of the second visual area, V2. We found it important to separate out the original definition of the hypercolumn from other associated observations and concepts, not all of which are applicable to V2. We present results indicating that, as in V1, the V2 hypercolumns for orientation and binocular interaction (disparity) run roughly orthogonal to each other. We quantified the ‘nearest neighbour’ periodicities for the hypercolumns for ocular dominance, orientation, colour and disparity, and found a marked similarity in the periodicities of all of these hypercolumns, both across hypercolumn type and across visual areas V1 and V2. The results support an underlying common mechanism that constrains the anatomical extent of hypercolumn systems, and highlight the original definition of the cortical hypercolumn.},

This claim has remained controversial and much debated. We replicated the study of Rockel et al. with attention to modern stereological precepts and show that indeed primate V1 is 2.5 times denser (number of neurons per square millimeter) than many other cortical regions and nonprimate V1s; we also show that V2 is 1.7 times as dense.

Using whole cell and field-potential recordings, this study explored whether repetitive perforant-path stimulation at physiological frequencies could induce epileptiform bursts in dentate gyrus minislices from rats with kainate-induced epilepsy. Control slices from saline-treated rats responded to single perforant-path stimulation with an excitatory postsynaptic potential ({EPSP}) and a single population spike in normal medium, and repetitive stimulation at different frequencies (0.1, 1, 2, 5, 10 Hz) did not cause significant increases in the responses. Most minislices (82\%) from rats with kainate-induced epilepsy also responded to single perforant-path stimulation with an {EPSP} and a single population spike/action potential, but some slices (18\%) had a more robust response with a prolonged duration and negative {DC} shift or responses with two to three population spikes. Repetitive perforant-path stimulation at 5–10 Hz, however, transformed the single-spike responses into epileptiform bursts with multiple spikes in half (52\%) of the slices, while lower frequency (e.g., ≤1 Hz) stimulation failed to produce these changes. The emergence of epileptiform bursts was consistently associated with a negative field-potential {DC} shift and membrane depolarization. The results suggest that compared with the controls, the “gate” function of the dentate gyrus is compromised in rats with kainate-induced epilepsy, and epileptiform bursts (but not full-length seizure events) can be induced in minislices by repetitive synaptic stimulation at physiological frequencies in the range of hippocampal theta rhythm (i.e., 5–10 Hz).},

{METHODS}: For seizure generation, rats were kindled by electrical stimulation of perforant path in semi-rapid kindling manner (12 stimulations per day at 10 min intervals at afterdischarge threshold intensity).To determine the effect of {LFS} (0.1 ms pulse duration at 1 Hz, 800 pulses) on seizure generation, {LFS} was applied to the perforant path 5 min after the last kindling stimulation daily. {AM}281, a {CB}1 receptor antagonist, was microinjected into the lateral ventricle immediately after the last kindling stimulation (before {LFS} application) at the doses of 0.5 and 2 μg/μl during kindling procedure. The expression of cannabinoid receptors in the dentate gyrus was also investigated using immunohistochemistry.
{RESULTS}: Application of {LFS} had inhibitory effect on development of kindled seizures (kindling rate). Microinjection of {AM}281 (0.5 μg/μl) immediately after the last kindling stimulation (before {LFS} application) reduced the inhibitory effect of {LFS} on the kindling rate and suppressed the effects of {LFS} on potentiation (increasing the magnitude) of both population spike amplitude and population excitatory postsynaptic potential slope during kindling acquisition. {AM}281 pretreatment also prevented the effects of {LFS} on kindling-induced increase in early and late paired pulse depression. The higher dose of {AM}281 (2 μg/μl) failed to exert the effects observed with its lower dose (0.5 μg/μl). In addition, there was a decreased {CB}1 receptors immunostaining in kindled animals compared to control. However, application of {LFS} following kindling stimulations led to overexpression of {CB}1 receptors in the dentate gyrus.
{CONCLUSION}: Obtained results showed that activation of overexpressed cannabinoid {CB}1 receptors by endogenous cannabinoids may have a role in mediating the inhibitory effect of {LFS} on perforant path kindled seizures.},

	abstract = {Previous electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that in a subset of hippocampal slices from tissue resected from patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, perforant path stimulation can elicit prolonged negative field-potential shifts in the dentate granule cell layer (Masukawa et al., 1989. Brain Res. 493, 168–174; Isokawa and Fried, 1996. Neuroscience 72, 31–37). In this investigation, hippocampal slices were prepared from rats: (1) 2–4 days following kainate treatment, when little or no reorganization of the mossy fibers would be present and (2) 3–13 months after kainate treatment, when mossy fiber reorganization would have occurred. In saline-treated controls, perforant path stimulation typically evoked a single population spike. In contrast, perforant path stimulation could evoke 3–12 population spikes in nearly all slices from kainate-injected rats 2–4 days and 3–13 months after treatment. The majority of slices from kainate-injected rats 3–13 months after treatment had qualitatively similar responses to perforant path stimulation as that observed in slices from kainate-injected rats 2–4 days after treatment. However, in 17\% of the slices from kainate-treated rats 3–13 months after treatment (29\% of rats), the multiple population spikes were followed by a prolonged negative field-potential shift (duration: 140 ms–1.5 s) with variable superimposed population spike activity. This type of epileptiform activity was only observed in slices with robust Timm’s staining in the inner molecular layer and similar responses could also be evoked in these slices with hilar stimulation. Furthermore, pharmacological depression of inhibition by adding the {GABAA} receptor antagonist bicuculline unmasked hilar-evoked prolonged negative field-potential shifts in most slices from kainate-treated rats 3–13 months following treatment, and these slices had robust Timm’s staining in the inner molecular layer. Such events were not observed in slices from saline-treated controls or kainate-injected rats 2–4 days after treatment. In conclusion, the prolonged negative field-potential shifts evoked to perforant path stimulation in normal {ACSF} were associated with mossy fiber reorganization, but the relative contribution of altered inhibition, increased synaptic excitation, or even non-synaptic mechanisms is unknown.},

The perirhinal cortex ({PRC}) plays a role in object recognition memory, while the hippocampus is required for certain forms of spatial memory and episodic memory. The lateral entorhinal cortex ({LEC}) receives direct projections from {PRC} and is one of the two major cortical inputs to the hippocampus. The transformations that occur between {PRC} and {LEC} neural representations are not well understood. Here, we show that {PRC} and {LEC} had similarly high proportions of neurons with object-related activity ({PRC} 52/94; {LEC} 72/153), as expected from their locations in the “what” pathway into the hippocampus. However, {LEC} unit activity showed more spatial stability than {PRC} unit activity. A minority of {LEC} neurons showed stable spatial firing fields away from objects; these firing fields strongly resembled hippocampal place fields. None of the {PRC} neurons showed this place-like firing. None of the {PRC} or {LEC} neurons demonstrated the high firing rates associated with interneurons in hippocampus or medial entorhinal cortex, further dissociating this information processing stream from the path-integration based, movement-related processing of the medial entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. These results provide evidence for nonspatial information processing in the {PRC}-{LEC} pathway, as well as showing a functional dissociation between {PRC} and {LEC}, with more purely nonspatial representations in {PRC} and combined spatial-nonspatial representations in {LEC}.},

	abstract = {Episodic memory is defined as the ability to recall events in a spatiotemporal context. Formation of such memories is critically dependent on the hippocampal formation and its inputs from the entorhinal cortex. To be able to support the formation of episodic memories, entorhinal cortex and hippocampal formation should contain a neuronal code that follows several requirements. First, the code should include information about position of the agent (“where”), sequence of events (“when”), and the content of the experience itself (“what”). Second, the code should arise instantly thereby being able to support memory formation of one-shot experiences. For successful encoding and to avoid interference between memories during recall, variations in location, time, or in content of experience should result in unique ensemble activity. Finally, the code should capture several different resolutions of experience so that the necessary details relevant for future memory-based predictions will be stored. We review how neuronal codes in entorhinal cortex and hippocampus follow these requirements and argue that during formation of episodic memories entorhinal cortex provides hippocampus with instant information about ongoing experience. Such information originates from (a) spatially modulated neurons in medial entorhinal cortex, including grid cells, which provide a stable and universal positional metric of the environment; (b) a continuously varying signal in lateral entorhinal cortex providing a code for the temporal progression of events; and (c) entorhinal neurons coding the content of experiences exemplified by object-coding and odor-selective neurons. During formation of episodic memories, information from these systems are thought to be encoded as unique sequential ensemble activity in hippocampus, thereby encoding associations between the content of an event and its spatial and temporal contexts. Upon exposure to parts of the encoded stimuli, activity in these ensembles can be reinstated, leading to reactivation of the encoded activity pattern and memory recollection.},

The entorhinal cortex receives strong dopaminergic inputs which may modulate working memory for motivationally significant information. We used whole cell recordings in in vitro rat brain slices to assess the effects of dopamine on persistent firing in layer {III} neurons initiated by depolarizing current injection. Persistent firing during pharmacological block of ionotropic excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, and in the presence of the cholinergic agonist carbachol (10 μM), was observed in 39\% of layer {III} pyramidal cells. Addition of 1 μM dopamine suppressed the incidence of persistent firing and similarly reduced the mean probability of induction of persistent firing at each current step, without significantly affecting the latency, duration, plateau potential, or frequency of persistent firing that was induced. These results indicate that dopamine can result in a suppression of the induction of persistent firing in layer {III} entorhinal neurons, while still being permissive of persistent firing once it is initiated.},

	abstract = {Acetylcholine is a key modulator of hippocampal and entorhinal cortex ({EC}) function. The majority of cholinergic projections targeting these structures originate in the basal forebrain complex, specifically the medial septum. Many studies focused on the behavioral effects involving these projections, but there still is a paucity regarding their connectivity in the target area. Here we provide this missing link. By combining optogenetics with whole-cell recordings in superficial {EC} layers, we identified the synaptic target cells of septal cholinergic neurons. This level of analysis is an important step toward a better understanding of the modulatory action of acetylcholine in {EC} in vivo., The entorhinal cortex ({EC}) plays a pivotal role in processing and conveying spatial information to the hippocampus. It has long been known that {EC} neurons are modulated by cholinergic input from the medial septum. However, little is known as to how synaptic release of acetylcholine affects the different cell types in {EC}. Here we combined optogenetics and patch-clamp recordings to study the effect of cholinergic axon stimulation on distinct neurons in {EC}. We found dense cholinergic innervations that terminate in layer I and {II} ({LI} and {LII}). Light-activated stimulation of septal cholinergic projections revealed differential responses in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in {LI} and {LII} of both medial and lateral {EC}. We observed depolarizing responses mediated by nicotinic and muscarinic receptors primarily in putative serotonin receptor (p5HT3R)-expressing interneurons. Hyperpolarizing muscarinic receptor-mediated responses were found predominantly in excitatory cells. Additionally, some excitatory as well as a higher fraction of inhibitory neurons received mono- and/or polysynaptic {GABAergic} inputs, revealing that medial septum cholinergic neurons have the capacity to corelease {GABA} alongside acetylcholine. Notably, the synaptic effects of acetylcholine were similar in neurons of both medial and lateral {EC}. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that {EC} activity may be differentially modulated via the activation or the suppression of distinct subsets of {LI} and {LII} neurons by the septal cholinergic system.},

Holistic representations of the sequence structure related to memory recall and the timeline of events could be reconstructed from entorhinal multi-voxel patterns. Our findings demonstrate representations of temporal structure in the {alEC}; dovetailing with temporal information carried by population signals in the lateral entorhinal cortex of navigating rodents and {alEC} activations during temporal memory retrieval.

	abstract = {Fan cells in layer {II} of the lateral entorhinal cortex ({LEC}) form a main component of the projection to the dentate gyrus, {CA}3 and {CA}2 of the hippocampal formation. This projection has a counterpart originating from stellate cells in layer {II} of the medial entorhinal cortex ({MEC}). Available evidence suggests that the two pathways carry different information, exemplified by a difference in spatial tuning of cells in {LEC} and {MEC}. The grid cell, a prominent position-modulated cell type present in {MEC}, has been postulated to derive its characteristic hexagonal firing pattern from dominant disynaptic inhibitory connections between hippocampal-projecting stellate cells. Given that grid cells have not been described in {LEC}, we aim to describe the local synaptic connectivity of fan cells, to explore whether the network architecture is similar to that of the {MEC} stellate cell. Using a combination of in vitro multicell electrophysiological and optogenetic approaches in acute slices from rodents of either sex, we show that excitatory connectivity between fan cells is very sparse. Fan cells connect preferentially with two distinct types of inhibitory interneurons, suggesting disynaptic inhibitory coupling as the main form of communication among fan cells. These principles are similar to those reported for stellate cells in {MEC}, indicating an overall comparable local circuit architecture of the main hippocampal-projecting cell types in the lateral and medial entorhinal cortex., {SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT} Our data provide the first description of the synaptic microcircuit of hippocampal-projecting layer {II} cells in the lateral entorhinal cortex. We show that these cells make infrequent monosynaptic connections with each other, and that they preferentially communicate through a disynaptic inhibitory network. This is similar to the microcircuit of hippocampal-projecting stellate cells in layer {II} of the medial entorhinal cortex, but dissimilar to the connectivity observed in layer 2 of neocortex. In medial entorhinal cortex, the observed network structure has been proposed to underlie the firing pattern of grid cells. This opens the possibility that layer {II} cells in lateral entorhinal cortex exhibit regular firing patterns in an unexplored domain.},

	abstract = {Hippocampal neurons show a strong modulation by theta frequency oscillations. This modulation is thought to be important not only for temporal encoding and decoding of information in the hippocampal system, but also for temporal ordering of neuronal activities on timescales at which physiological mechanisms of synaptic plasticity operate. The medial entorhinal cortex ({MEC}), one of the two major cortical inputs to the hippocampus, is known to show theta modulation. Here, we show that the local field potentials ({LFPs}) in the other major cortical input to the hippocampus, the lateral entorhinal cortex ({LEC}), show weaker theta oscillations than those shown in the {MEC}. Neurons in {LEC} also show weaker theta modulation than that of neurons in {MEC}. These findings suggest that {LEC} inputs are integrated into hippocampal representations in a qualitatively different manner than the {MEC} inputs. Furthermore, {MEC} grid cells increase the scale of their periodic spatial firing patterns along the dorsoventral axis, corresponding to the increasing size of place fields along the septotemporal axis of the hippocampus. We show here a corresponding gradient in the tendency of {MEC} neural firing to skip alternate theta cycles. We propose a simple model based on interference of delta oscillations with theta oscillations to explain this behavior.},

	abstract = {Episodic memory incorporates information about specific events or occasions including spatial locations and the contextual features of the environment in which the event took place. It has been modeled in rats using spontaneous exploration of novel configurations of objects, their locations, and the contexts in which they are presented. While we have a detailed understanding of how spatial location is processed in the brain relatively little is known about where the nonspatial contextual components of episodic memory are processed. Initial experiments measured c-fos expression during an object-context recognition ({OCR}) task to examine which networks within the brain process contextual features of an event. Increased c-fos expression was found in the lateral entorhinal cortex ({LEC}; a major hippocampal afferent) during {OCR} relative to control conditions. In a subsequent experiment it was demonstrated that rats with lesions of {LEC} were unable to recognize object-context associations yet showed normal object recognition and normal context recognition. These data suggest that contextual features of the environment are integrated with object identity in {LEC} and demonstrate that recognition of such object-context associations requires the {LEC}. This is consistent with the suggestion that contextual features of an event are processed in {LEC} and that this information is combined with spatial information from medial entorhinal cortex to form episodic memory in the hippocampus. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Because {MEC} projects preferentially to the proximal part of the {CA}1, bordering {CA}2, whereas {LEC} innervates only the distal part, bordering subiculum, we asked if spatial tuning is graded along the transverse axis of {CA}1. Tetrodes were implanted along the entire proximodistal axis of dorsal {CA}1 in rats. Data were recorded in cylinders large enough to elicit firing at more than one location in many neurons. Distal {CA}1 cells showed more dispersed firing and had a larger number of firing fields than proximal cells. Phase-locking of spikes to {MEC} theta oscillations was weaker in distal {CA}1 than in proximal {CA}1. The findings suggest that spatial firing in {CA}1 is organized transversally, with the strongest spatial modulation occurring in the {MEC}-associated proximal part.},

Similarly pronounced encoding of time was not present in the medial entorhinal cortex or in hippocampal areas {CA}3–{CA}1. When animals’ experiences were constrained by behavioural tasks to become similar across repeated trials, the encoding of temporal flow across trials was reduced, whereas the encoding of time relative to the start of trials was improved. The findings suggest that populations of lateral entorhinal cortex neurons represent time inherently through the encoding of experience. This representation of episodic time may be integrated with spatial inputs from the medial entorhinal cortex in the hippocampus, allowing the hippocampus to store a unified representation of what, where and when.},

Here, however, we discuss how object and spatial information are in fact closely integrated in vision and memory. The ventral, object-processing visual pathway carries precise spatial information, transformed from retinotopic coordinates into relative dimensions. At the final stages of the ventral pathway (including area {TEd}), object-sensitive neurons are intermixed with neurons that process large-scale environmental space. {TEd} projects primarily to perirhinal cortex ({PRC}), which in turn projects to lateral entorhinal cortex ({LEC}). {PRC} and {LEC} also combine object and spatial information. For example, {PRC} and {LEC} neurons exhibit place fields that are evoked by landmark objects or the remembered locations of objects. Thus, spatial information, on both local and global scales, is deeply integrated into the ventral/temporal object-processing pathway in vision and memory.},

They are believed to reflect inhibitory field potentials, which facilitate information transfer by synchronizing neuronal activity over long distances. {HFOs} in the range of 250–600 Hz (fast ripples, {FRs}) are pathologic and are readily recorded from hippocampus and parahippocampal structures of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, as well as rodent models of this disorder. These oscillations, and similar {HFOs} recorded from neocortex of patients, appear to identify brain tissue capable of spontaneous ictogenesis and are believed to reflect the neuronal substrates of epileptogenesis and epileptogenicity. The distinction between normal and pathologic {HFOs} ({pHFOs}), however, cannot be made on the basis of frequency alone, as oscillations in the {FR} frequency range can be recorded from some areas of normal neocortex, whereas oscillations in the ripple frequency range are present in epileptic dentate gyrus where normal ripples never occur and, therefore, appear to be pathologic. The suggestion that {FRs} may be harmonics of normal ripples is unlikely, because of their spatially distinct generators, and evidence that {FRs} reflect synchronized firing of abnormally bursting neurons rather than inhibitory field potentials. These synchronous population spikes, however, can fire at ripple frequencies, and their harmonics appear to give rise to {FRs}. Investigations into the fundamental neuronal processes responsible for {pHFOs} could provide insights into basic mechanisms of epilepsy. The potential for {pHFOs} to act as biomarkers for epileptogenesis and epileptogenicity is also discussed.},

	abstract = {In patients being evaluated for epilepsy and in animal models of epilepsy, electrophysiological recordings are carried to capture seizures to determine the existence of epilepsy. Electroencephalography recordings from the scalp, or sometimes directly from the brain, are also used to locate brain areas where seizure begins, and in surgical treatment help plan the area for resection. As seizures are unpredictable and can occur infrequently, ictal recordings are not ideal in terms of time, cost, or risk when, for example, determining the efficacy of existing or new anti-seizure drugs, evaluating potential anti-epileptogenic interventions, or for prolonged intracerebral electrode studies. Thus, there is a need to identify and validate other electrophysiological biomarkers of epilepsy that could be used to diagnose, treat, cure, and prevent epilepsy. Electroencephalography recordings in the epileptic brain contain other interictal electrophysiological disturbances that can occur more frequently than seizures, such as interictal spikes ({IIS}) and sharp waves, and from invasive studies using wide bandwidth recording and small diameter electrodes, the discovery of pathological high-frequency oscillations ({HFOs}) and microseizures. Of {IIS}, {HFOs}, and microseizures, a significant amount of recent research has focused on {HFOs} in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. Results from studies in animals with epilepsy and presurgical patients have consistently found a strong association between {HFOs} and epileptogenic brain tissue that suggest {HFOs} could be a potential biomarker of epileptogenicity and epileptogenesis. Here, we discuss several aspects of {HFOs}, as well as {IIS} and microseizures, and the evidence that supports their role as biomarkers of epilepsy.},

Spatial navigation and context-dependent episodic memories are represented in several interconnected regions including the hippocampal and entorhinal cortices, but the cellular mechanisms for their dynamic coupling remain to be defined. Using monosynaptically-restricted retrograde viral tracing in mice, we identified a subcortical {GABAergic} input from the medial septum that terminated in the entorhinal cortex, with collaterals innervating the dorsal presubiculum. Extracellularly recording and labeling {GABAergic} entorhinal-projecting neurons in awake behaving mice show that these subcortical neurons, named orchid cells, fire in long rhythmic bursts during immobility and locomotion. Orchid cells discharge near the peak of hippocampal and entorhinal theta oscillations, couple to entorhinal gamma oscillations, and target subpopulations of extra-hippocampal {GABAergic} interneurons. Thus, orchid cells are a specialized source of rhythmic subcortical {GABAergic} modulation of ‘upstream’ and ‘downstream’ cortico-cortical circuits involved in mnemonic functions.},

	abstract = {Information processing within neuronal networks is determined by a dynamic partnership between principal neurons and local circuit inhibitory interneurons. The population of {GABAergic} interneurons is extremely heterogeneous and comprises, in many brain regions, cells with divergent morphological and physiological properties, distinct molecular expression profiles, and highly specialized functions. {GABAergic} interneurons have been studied extensively during the past two decades, especially in the hippocampus, which is a relatively simple cortical structure. Different types of hippocampal inhibitory interneurons control spike initiation [e.g., axo-axonic and basket cells ({BCs})] and synaptic integration (e.g., bistratified and oriens–lacunosum moleculare interneurons) within pyramidal neurons and synchronize local network activity, providing a means for functional segregation of neuronal ensembles and proper routing of hippocampal information. Thus, it is thought that, at least in the hippocampus, {GABAergic} inhibitory interneurons represent critical regulating elements at all stages of information processing, from synaptic integration and spike generation to large-scale network activity. However, this raises an important question: if inhibitory interneurons are fundamental for network computations, what are the mechanisms that control the activity of the interneurons themselves? Given the essential role of synaptic inhibition in the regulation of neuronal activity, it would be logical to expect that specific inhibitory mechanisms have evolved to control the operation of interneurons. Here, we review the mechanisms of synaptic inhibition of interneurons and discuss their role in the operation of hippocampal inhibitory circuits.},

	abstract = {One of the critical factors in determining network behavior of neurons is the influence of local circuit connections among interneurons. The short-term synaptic plasticity and the subtype of presynaptic calcium channels used at local circuit connections of inhibitory interneurons in {CA}1 were investigated using dual whole-cell recordings combined with biocytin and double immunofluorescence labeling in acute slices of P18- to 21-day-old rat stratum radiatum ({SR}) and stratum lacunosum moleculare ({SLM}). Two forms of temporally distinct synaptic facilitation were observed among interneuron connections involving presynaptic cholecystokinin ({CCK})-positive cells in {SR}, frequency-dependent facilitation, and a delayed onset of release (45–80 ms) with subsequent facilitation ({DORF}). Inhibition at both these synapses was under tonic cannabinoid-type 1 ({CB}1) receptor activity. {DORF} synapses did not display conventional release-dependent properties; however, blocking {CB}1 receptors with antagonist {AM}-251 (10 μM) altered the synaptic transmission to frequency-dependent depression with a fast onset of release (2–4 ms). Presynaptic {CCK}-negative interneurons in {SLM} elicited inhibitory postsynaptic potentials ({IPSPs}) insensitive to {CB}1 receptor pharmacology displayed frequency-dependent depression. Release of {GABA} at facilitating synapses was solely mediated via N-type presynaptic calcium channels, whereas depressing synapses utilized P/Q-type channels. These data reveal two distinct models of neurotransmitter release patterns among interneuron circuits that correlate with the subtype of presynaptic calcium channel. These data suggest that endocannabinoids act via {CB}1 receptors to selectively modulate N-type calcium channels to alter signal transmission.},

The neurogliaform cell ({NGFC}) has recently been identified as a key generator of slow {GABAA} receptor-mediated volume transmission in the isocortex. However, the mechanisms underlying slow {GABAA} receptor-mediated {IPSCs} and their use-dependent plasticity remain unknown. Here, we provide experimental and modeling data showing that hippocampal {NGFCs} generate an unusually prolonged (tens of milliseconds) but low-concentration (micromolar range) {GABA} transient, which is responsible for the slow response kinetics and which leads to a robust desensitization of postsynaptic {GABAA} receptors. This strongly contributes to the use-dependent synaptic depression elicited by various patterns of {NGFC} activity including the one detected during theta network oscillations in vivo. Synaptic depression mediated by {NGFCs} is likely to play an important modulatory role in the feedforward inhibition of {CA}1 pyramidal cells provided by the entorhinal cortex.},

We used several techniques to test the alternative hypothesis that {CCK} and {PV} cells are coupled by chemical synapses. Triple immunofluorescence confocal microscopy revealed numerous axosomatic, axodendritic, and axoaxonic contacts stained for {CCK}, {PV}, and the presynaptic marker synaptophysin. The existence of mutual {CCK} and {PV} synapses was supported by dual {EM} immunolabeling. Paired whole-cell recordings detected unitary {GABAAergic} synaptic transmission between identified {CCK} and {PV} cells, and single {CCK} cells could transiently inhibit action potential firing of synaptically coupled {PV} cells. We conclude that the major hippocampal perisomatic-targeting interneurons communicate synaptically. This communication should affect neuronal network activity, including neuronal oscillations, in which the {CCK} and {PV} cells have well established roles. The prevalence of {CCK} and {PV} networks in other brain regions suggests that internetwork interactions could be generally important.},

Prior to kainate-induced transient epochs of gamma activity, two distinct classes of oriens interneurones, oriens lacunosum-moleculare (O-{LM}) and trilaminar cells, showed prominent differences in their membrane and firing properties, as well as in the amplitude and kinetics of their excitatory postsynaptic events. In the active network both types of neurone received a phasic barrage of gamma frequency excitatory inputs but, due to their differential functional integration, showed clear differences in their output patterns. While O-{LM} cells fired intermittently at theta frequency, trilaminar interneurones discharged on every gamma cycle and showed a propensity to fire spike doublets. Two other classes of fast spiking interneurones, perisomatic targeting basket and bistratified cells, in the active network discharged predominantly single action potentials on every gamma cycle. Thus, within a locally excited network, O-{LM} cells are likely to provide a theta-frequency patterned output to distal dendritic segments, whereas basket and bistratified cells are involved in the generation of locally synchronous gamma band oscillations. The anatomy and output profile of trilaminar cells suggest they are involved in the projection of locally generated gamma rhythms to distal sites. Therefore a division of labour appears to exist whereby different frequencies and spatiotemporal properties of hippocampal rhythms are mediated by different interneurone subtypes.},

	abstract = {We recorded single hippocampal cells while rats performed a jump avoidance task. In this task, a rat was dropped onto the metal floor of a 33 cm gray wooden cube and was given a mild electric shock if it did not jump up onto the box rim in {\textless}15 s. We found that many hippocampal pyramidal cells and most interneurons discharged preferentially at the drop, the jump, or on both events. By simultaneously recording the hippocampal {EEG}, we found that the discharge of most of the event-related pyramidal cells was modulated by the theta rhythm and moreover that discharge precessed with theta cycles in the same manner seen for pyramidal cells in their role as place cells. The elevations of firing rate at drop and jump were accompanied by increases in theta frequency. We conclude that many of the features of event-related discharge can be interpreted as being equivalent to the activity of place cells with firing fields above the box floor. Nevertheless, there are sufficient differences between expectations from place cells and observed activity to indicate that pyramidal cells may be able to signal events as well as location.},

	abstract = {We studied neurogliaform neurons in the stratum lacunosum moleculare of the {CA}1 hippocampal area. These interneurons have short stellate dendrites and an extensive axonal arbor mainly located in the stratum lacunosum moleculare. Single-cell reverse transcription-{PCR} showed that these neurons were {GABAergic} and that the majority expressed {mRNA} for neuropeptide Y. Most neurogliaform neurons tested were immunoreactive for α-actinin-2, and many stratum lacunosum moleculare interneurons coexpressed α-actinin-2 and neuropeptide Y. Neurogliaform neurons received monosynaptic, {DNQX}-sensitive excitatory input from the perforant path, and 40 Hz stimulation of this input evoked {EPSCs} displaying either depression or initial facilitation, followed by depression. Paired recordings performed between neurogliaform neurons showed that 85\% of pairs were electrically connected and 70\% were also connected via {GABAergic} synapses. Injection of sine waveforms into neurons during paired recordings resulted in transmission of the waveforms through the electrical synapse. Unitary {IPSCs} recorded from neurogliaform pairs readily fatigued, had a slow decay, and had a strong depression of the synaptic response at a 5 Hz stimulation frequency that was antagonized by the {GABAB} antagonist (2S)-3-[[(1S)-1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]amino-2-hydroxypropyl](phenylmethyl) phosphinic acid ({CGP}55845). The amplitude of the first {IPSC} during the 5 Hz stimulation was also increased by {CGP}55845, suggesting a tonic inhibition of synaptic transmission. A small unitary {GABAB}-mediated {IPSC} could also be detected, providing the first evidence for such a component between {GABAergic} interneurons. Electron microscopic localization of the {GABAB}1 subunit at neurogliaform synapses revealed the protein in both presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes. Our data disclose a novel interneuronal network well suited for modulating the flow of information between the entorhinal cortex and {CA}1 hippocampus.},

We investigated this idea using multisite, whole-cell recordings and Ca2+ imaging and found that properly timed, repetitive stimulation of both pathways results in the generation of large plateau potentials in distal dendrites of {CA}1 pyramidal neurons. These dendritic plateau potentials produce widespread Ca2+ influx, large after-depolarizations, burst firing output, and long-term potentiation of perforant path synapses. Plateau duration is directly related to the strength and temporal overlap of pathway activation and involves back-propagating action potentials and both {NMDA} receptors and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Thus, the occurrence of highly correlated {SC} and {PP} input to {CA}1 is signaled by a dramatic change in output mode and an increase in input efficacy, all induced by a large plateau potential in the distal dendrites of {CA}1 pyramidal neurons.},

	abstract = {1. Paired intracellular recordings were made in rat hippocampal slice cultures, with the use of either sharp microelectrodes or the whole cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique. Unitary synaptic connections were studied between pyramidal and nonpyramidal cells within and between areas {CA}1 and {CA}3. 2. Monosynaptic excitatory synaptic responses between {CA}3 pyramidal neurons were found in 56\% of cell pairs (n = 91, 28 postsynaptic cells). Monosynaptic connections from a {CA}3 cell to a {CA}1 cell were observed in 76\% of cell pairs (n = 125, 26 postsynaptic cells), but from {CA}1 to {CA}3 neurons in only 8\% of cell pairs (n = 13, 13 postsynaptic cells). Monosynaptic excitatory connections were found in only 16\% of {CA}1/{CA}1 cell pairs (n = 25, 10 postsynaptic cells). 3. Disynaptic inhibition was commonly observed between {CA}3 cell pairs (43\%), but rarely found between {CA}3-{CA}1 pyramidal cell pairs (2\%). In 50\% of {CA}3 pyramidal cell pairs, synchronous inhibitory postsynaptic potentials ({IPSPs}) in both cells could be triggered by an action potential in one pyramidal cell. Reciprocal monosynaptic connections were found between 75\% of interneuron and pyramidal cell pairs within area {CA}3. 4. The latency of monosynaptic {CA}3- to {CA}1-cell responses was significantly longer than for responses between two {CA}3 cells. Within area {CA}3 the latencies for inhibitory synaptic responses between interneurons and pyramidal cells were significantly shorter than those for excitatory responses between pyramidal cells. Monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials ({EPSPs}) in interneurons had a significantly shorter time-to-peak than those recorded in pyramidal neurons. 5. 6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione ({CNQX})- and D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate ({AP}5)-sensitive components were identified in unitary monosynaptic {EPSPs} in {CA}3-{CA}3 and {CA}3-{CA}1 pyramidal cell pairs. The {CNQX}-sensitive component had a mean time-to-peak and duration of 6.2 +/- 0.3 ({SE}) ms and 61.2 +/- 2.0 ms, respectively, and an amplitude of approximately 1 {mV} (n = 93). The {AP}5-sensitive component of {EPSPs} was only detected when the cell was depolarized with respect to the resting potential, had a mean time-to-peak of 41 +/- 5 ms and duration of 121 +/- 11 ms (n = 6), and increased in amplitude with postsynaptic depolarization. 6. Unitary monosynaptic {IPSPs} between an interneuron and a pyramidal cell had a mean amplitude of approximately 1 {mV} and were fully blocked by gamma-aminobutyric acid-A ({GABAA}) receptor antagonists (n = 3). 7. Unitary inhibitory responses were found only within, but not between, areas {CA}3 or {CA}1.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

	abstract = {μ-Opioid receptors (μ{ORs}) are selectively expressed on interneurons in area {CA}1 of the hippocampus. Fast-spiking, parvalbumin-expressing, basket cells express μ{ORs}, but circumstantial evidence suggests that another major, unidentified, {GABAergic} cell class must also be modulated by μ{ORs}. Here we report that the abundant, dendritically targeting, neurogliaform family of cells (Ivy and neurogliaform cells) is a previously unrecognized target of direct modulation by μ{ORs}. Ivy and neurogliaform cells are not only numerous but also have unique properties, including promiscuous gap junctions formed with various interneuronal subtypes, volume transmission, and the ability to produce a postsynaptic {GABAB} response after a single presynaptic spike. Using a mouse line expressing green fluorescent protein under the neuropeptide Y promoter, we find that, across all layers of {CA}1, activation of μ{ORs} hyperpolarizes Ivy and neurogliaform cells. Furthermore, paired recordings between synaptically coupled Ivy and pyramidal cells show that Ivy cell terminals are dramatically inhibited by μ{OR} activation. Effects in Ivy and neurogliaform cells are seen at similar concentrations of agonist as those producing inhibition in fast-spiking parvalbumin basket cells. We also report that Ivy cells display the recently described phenomenon of persistent firing, a state of continued firing in the absence of continued input, and that induction of persistent firing is inhibited by μ{OR} activation. Together, these findings identify a major, previously unrecognized, target of μ{OR} modulation. Given the prominence of this cell type in and beyond {CA}1, as well as its unique role in microcircuitry, opioid modulation of neurogliaform cells has wide implications.},

These cells have a defining dense local axonal plexus, and display unique synaptic properties, including a biphasic postsynaptic response with both a slow {GABAA} component, and a {GABAB} component, following even a single action potential. The type of transmission displayed by these cells has been termed ‘volume transmission,’ distinct from both tonic and classical synaptic transmission. Electrical connections are also notable in that, unlike other classes, neurogliaform family cells will form gap junctions not only with other neurogliaform cells, but also with members of other {GABAergic} cell classes. In this review we focus on neurogliaform and Ivy cells throughout the hippocampal formation, where recent studies highlight their role in feedforward inhibition, uncover their ability to display a phenomenon called persistent firing, and reveal their modulation by opioids. The unique properties of this class of cells, their abundance, rich connectivity, and modulation by clinically relevant drugs make them an attractive target for future studies in vivo during different behavioral and pharmacological conditions.},

We propose that this conversion is necessary to provide orthogonal hippocampal time representations to encode the temporal sequence of events in hippocampal episodic memory, and we support that with analytic arguments. We demonstrate that this processing can produce hippocampal neuronal ensembles that not only show replay of the sequence later on, but can also do this in reverse order in reverse replay. This research addresses a major issue in neuroscience: the mechanisms by which time is encoded in the brain and how the time representations are then useful in the hippocampal memory of events and their order.},

	abstract = {Synaptic neurotransmission is modified at cortical connections throughout life. Varying the amplitude of the postsynaptic response is one mechanism that generates flexible signaling in neural circuits. The timing of the synaptic response may also play a role. Here, we investigated whether weakening and loss of an entire connection between excitatory cortical neurons was foreshadowed in the timing of the postsynaptic response. We made electrophysiological recordings in rat primary somatosensory cortex that was undergoing experience-dependent loss of complete local excitatory connections. The synaptic latency of pyramid–pyramid connections, which typically comprise multiple synapses, was longer and more variable. Connection strength and latency were not correlated. Instead, prolonged latency was more closely related to progression of connection loss. The action potential waveform and axonal conduction velocity were unaffected, suggesting that the altered timing of neurotransmission was attributable to a synaptic mechanism. Modeling studies indicated that increasing the latency and jitter at a subset of synapses reduced the number of action potentials fired by a postsynaptic neuron. We propose that prolonged synaptic latency and diminished temporal precision of neurotransmission are hallmarks of impending loss of a cortical connection.},

	abstract = {The autoassociative memory model of hippocampal field {CA}3 postulates that Hebbian associations among external input features produce attractor states embedded in a recurrent synaptic matrix. In contrast, the attractor-map model postulates that a two-dimensional continuum of attractor states is preconfigured in the network during development and that transitions among these states are governed primarily by self-motion information (“path-integration”), giving rise to the strong spatial characteristic of hippocampal activity. In this model, learned associations between “coordinates” on the attractor map and external cues can result in abrupt jumps between states, in the case of mismatches between the current input and previous associations between internal coordinates and external landmarks. Both models predict attractor dynamics, but for fundamentally different reasons; however, the two models are not a priori mutually exclusive. We contrasted these two models by comparing the dynamics of state transitions when two previously learned environmental shapes were morphed between their endpoints, in animals that had first experienced the environments either at the same location, or at two different locations, connected by a passageway through which they walked. As predicted from attractor-map theory, the latter animals expressed abrupt transitions between representations at the midpoint of the morph series. Contrary to the predictions of autoassociation theory, the former group expressed no evidence of attractor dynamics during the morph series; there was only a gradual transition between endpoints. The results of this critical test thus cast the autoassociator theory for {CA}3 into doubt and indicate the need for a new theory for this structure.},

During exploration, within single cycles of the ongoing theta rhythm that dominates hippocampal local ﬁeld potentials, place cells form precisely ordered sequences of activity. These neural sequences result from the integration of both external inputs conveying sensory-motor information, and intrinsic network dynamics possibly related to memory processes. Their endogenous replay during subsequent sleep is critical for memory consolidation. The present review discusses possible mechanisms and functions of hippocampal theta sequences during exploration. We present several lines of evidence suggesting that these neural sequences play a key role in information processing and support the formation of initial memory traces, and discuss potential functional distinctions between neural sequences emerging during theta vs. awake sharp-wave ripples.},

	abstract = {Theta sequences are circuit-level activity patterns produced when groups of hippocampal place cells fire in sequences that reflect a compressed behavioral order of place fields within each theta cycle. The high temporal coordination between place cells exhibited in theta sequences is compatible with the induction of synaptic plasticity and has been proposed as one of the mechanisms underlying the encoding of episodic memory of recently acquired experience. Yet how theta sequences develop with experience has not been directly addressed. Here we simultaneously recorded large numbers of cells in the dorsal hippocampal {CA}1 area from rats exploring on a novel linear track. Although place cell firing activities accurately represented the animal's current location, distinct theta sequences were absent on the first lap but emerged immediately thereafter and remained stable once established. The absence of theta sequences on the first lap was not due to place field instability, decreased overall excitability of place cells, behavior variables, or the absence of individual neuronal phase precession. We observed strong single-lap phase precession in a significant percentage of place fields on the first lap and throughout the recording. Individual neuronal phase precession was stable from the first lap to subsequent laps but, across neurons, phase precession became more synchronized after experience, suggesting a novel mechanism for the generation of theta sequences. These results suggest that experience-independent temporal coding in individual neurons is combined with rapid plasticity of hippocampal neural networks during experience to acquire predictive representations of the immediate future.},

	abstract = {Neural circuits typically consist of many different types of neurons, and one faces a challenge in disentangling their individual contributions in measured neural activity. Classification of cells into inhibitory and excitatory neurons and localization of neurons on the basis of extracellular recordings are frequently employed procedures. Current approaches, however, need a lot of human intervention, which makes them slow, biased, and unreliable. In light of recent advances in deep learning techniques and exploiting the availability of neuron models with quasi-realistic three-dimensional morphology and physiological properties, we present a framework for automatized and objective classification and localization of cells based on the spatiotemporal profiles of the extracellular action potentials recorded by multielectrode arrays. We train convolutional neural networks on simulated signals from a large set of cell models and show that our framework can predict the position of neurons with high accuracy, more precisely than current state-of-the-art methods. Our method is also able to classify whether a neuron is excitatory or inhibitory with very high accuracy, substantially improving on commonly used clustering techniques. Furthermore, our new method seems to have the potential to separate certain subtypes of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The possibility of automatically localizing and classifying all neurons recorded with large high-density extracellular electrodes contributes to a more accurate and more reliable mapping of neural circuits.{NEW} \& {NOTEWORTHY} We propose a novel approach to localize and classify neurons from their extracellularly recorded action potentials with a combination of biophysically detailed neuron models and deep learning techniques. Applied to simulated data, this new combination of forward modeling and machine learning yields higher performance compared with state-of-the-art localization and classification methods.},

	abstract = {Memory formation is a complex process that involves information transfer to the hippocampus for temporary storage (i.e., encoding) and the reciprocal circuit that relays the temporary information back to the neocortex for long-term storage (i.e., consolidation). Acetylcholine has been shown to play a critical role in memory function by differentially modulating encoding and consolidation, but the underlying mechanism is yet unclear. We found that acetylcholine suppresses the hippocampus–entorhinal cortex pathway, which is the gateway to the consolidation pathway. We show that this inhibition is mediated by oriens lacunosum moleculare interneurons and that the ablation of these interneurons impairs proper memory encoding. We provide evidence that demonstrates how acetylcholine tones down the memory consolidation pathway for efficient memory encoding., Neuromodulation of neural networks, whereby a selected circuit is regulated by a particular modulator, plays a critical role in learning and memory. Among neuromodulators, acetylcholine ({ACh}) plays a critical role in hippocampus-dependent memory and has been shown to modulate neuronal circuits in the hippocampus. However, it has remained unknown how {ACh} modulates hippocampal output. Here, using in vitro and in vivo approaches, we show that {ACh}, by activating oriens lacunosum moleculare ({OLM}) interneurons and therefore augmenting the negative-feedback regulation to the {CA}1 pyramidal neurons, suppresses the circuit from the hippocampal area {CA}1 to the deep-layer entorhinal cortex ({EC}). We also demonstrate, using mouse behavior studies, that the ablation of {OLM} interneurons specifically impairs hippocampus-dependent but not hippocampus-independent learning. These data suggest that {ACh} plays an important role in regulating hippocampal output to the {EC} by activating {OLM} interneurons, which is critical for the formation of hippocampus-dependent memory.},

	abstract = {Nested oscillation occurs when the amplitude of a faster rhythm is coupled to the phase of a slower rhythm. It has been proposed to underlie the discrete nature of perception and the capacity of working memory and is a phenomenon observable in human brain imaging data. This paper compares three published methods for detecting nested oscillation and a fourth method proposed in this paper. These are: (i) the modulation index, (ii) the phase-locking value ({PLV}), (iii) the envelope-to-signal correlation ({ESC}) and (iv) a general linear model ({GLM}) measure derived from {ESC}. We applied the methods to electrocorticographic ({ECoG}) data recorded during a working-memory task and to data from a simulated hippocampal interneuron network. Further simulations were then made to address the dependence of each measure on signal to noise level, coupling phase, epoch length, sample rate, signal nonstationarity, and multi-phasic coupling. Our overall conclusion is that the {GLM} measure is the best all-round approach for detecting nested oscillation.},

	abstract = {Much of the research on cannabinoids ({CBs}) has focused on their effects at the molecular and synaptic level. However, the effects of {CBs} on the dynamics of neural circuits remains poorly understood. This study aims to disentangle the effects of {CBs} on the functional dynamics of the hippocampal Schaffer collateral synapse by using data-driven nonparametric modeling. Multi-unit activity was recorded from rats doing an working memory task in control sessions and under the influence of exogenously administered tetrahydrocannabinol ({THC}), the primary {CB} found in marijuana. It was found that {THC} left firing rate unaltered and only slightly reduced theta oscillations. Multivariate autoregressive models, estimated from spontaneous spiking activity, were then used to describe the dynamical transformation from {CA}3 to {CA}1. They revealed that {THC} served to functionally isolate {CA}1 from {CA}3 by reducing feedforward excitation and theta information flow. The functional isolation was compensated by increased feedback excitation within {CA}1, thus leading to unaltered firing rates. Finally, both of these effects were shown to be correlated with memory impairments in the working memory task. By elucidating the circuit mechanisms of {CBs}, these results help close the gap in knowledge between the cellular and behavioral effects of {CBs}.},

In this paper we develop appropriate techniques for analysis and visualization of such imaging data to separate the signal from the noise and characterize the signal. The techniques developed fall into the general category of multivariate time series analysis, and in particular we extensively use the multitaper framework of spectral analysis. We develop specific protocols for the analysis of {fMRI}, optical imaging, and {MEG} data, and illustrate the techniques by applications to real data sets generated by these imaging modalities. In general, the analysis protocols involve two distinct stages: "noise" characterization and suppression, and "signal" characterization and visualization. An important general conclusion of our study is the utility of a frequency-based representation, with short, moving analysis windows to account for nonstationarity in the data. Of particular note are 1) the development of a decomposition technique (space-frequency singular value decomposition) that is shown to be a useful means of characterizing the image data, and 2) the development of an algorithm, based on multitaper methods, for the removal of approximately periodic physiological artifacts arising from cardiac and respiratory sources.},

Laminar analysis of neocortical gamma bursts revealed multiple gamma oscillators of varying frequency and location, which were spatially confined and synchronized local groups of neurons. A significant fraction of putative pyramidal cells and interneurons as well as localized gamma oscillations in all recorded neocortical areas were phase biased by the hippocampal theta rhythm.

Specifically, we examined temporal and spatial correlations in the firing times of simultaneously recorded grid cells before and during hippocampal inactivation. Our analysis revealed evidence of network coherence in grid cells even in the absence of hippocampal input to the {MEC}, both in regular grid cells and in those that became head-direction cells after hippocampal inactivation.

	abstract = {The mechanisms for pattern completion and pattern separation are described in the context of a theory of hippocampal function in which the hippocampal {CA}3 system operates as a single attractor or autoassociation network to enable rapid, one-trial, associations between any spatial location (place in rodents, or spatial view in primates) and an object or reward, and to provide for completion of the whole memory during recall from any part. The factors important in the pattern completion in {CA}3 together with a large number of independent memories stored in {CA}3 include a sparse distributed representation which is enhanced by the graded firing rates of {CA}3 neurons, representations that are independent due to the randomizing effect of the mossy fibers, heterosynaptic long-term depression as well as long-term potentiation in the recurrent collateral synapses, and diluted connectivity to minimize the number of multiple synapses between any pair of {CA}3 neurons which otherwise distort the basins of attraction. Recall of information from {CA}3 is implemented by the entorhinal cortex perforant path synapses to {CA}3 cells, which acting as a pattern associator allow some pattern generalization. Pattern separation is performed in the dentate granule cells using competitive learning to convert grid-like entorhinal cortex firing to place-like fields. Pattern separation in {CA}3, which is important for completion of any one of the stored patterns from a fragment, is provided for by the randomizing effect of the mossy fiber synapses to which neurogenesis may contribute, by the large number of dentate granule cells each with a sparse representation, and by the sparse independent representations in {CA}3. Recall to the neocortex is achieved by a reverse hierarchical series of pattern association networks implemented by the hippocampo-cortical backprojections, each one of which performs some pattern generalization, to retrieve a complete pattern of cortical firing in higher-order cortical areas},

	abstract = {Classic computational theories of the mnemonic functions of the hippocampus ascribe the processes of pattern separation to the dentate gyrus ({DG}) and pattern completion to the {CA}3 region. Until the last decade, the large majority of single-unit studies of the hippocampus in behaving animals were from the {CA}1 region. The lack of data from the {DG}, {CA}3, and the entorhinal inputs to the hippocampus severely hampered the ability to test these theories with neurophysiological techniques. The past ten years have seen a major increase in the recordings from the {CA}3 region and the medial entorhinal cortex ({MEC}), with an increasing (but still limited) number of experiments from the lateral entorhinal cortex ({LEC}) and {DG}. This paper reviews a series of studies in a local–global cue mismatch (double-rotation) experiment in which recordings were made from cells in the anterior thalamus, {MEC}, {LEC}, {DG}, {CA}3, and {CA}1 regions. Compared to the standard cue environment, the change in the {DG} representation of the cue-mismatch environment was greater than the changes in its entorhinal inputs, providing support for the theory of pattern separation in the {DG}. In contrast, the change in the {CA}3 representation of the cue-mismatch environment was less than the changes in its entorhinal and {DG} inputs, providing support for a pattern completion/error correction function of {CA}3. The results are interpreted in terms of continuous attractor network models of the hippocampus and the relationship of these models to pattern separation and pattern completion theories. Whereas {DG} may perform an automatic pattern separation function, the attractor dynamics of {CA}3 allow it to perform a pattern separation or pattern completion function, depending on the nature of its inputs and the relative strength of the internal attractor dynamics.},

	abstract = {Hippocampus stores spatial representations, or maps, which are recalled each time a subject is placed in the corresponding environment. Across different environments of similar geometry, these representations show strong orthogonality in {CA}3 of hippocampus, whereas in the {CA}1 subfield a considerable overlap between the maps can be seen. The lower orthogonality decreases reliability of various decoders developed in an attempt to identify which of the stored maps is active at the moment. Especially, the problem with decoding emerges with a need to analyze data at high temporal resolution. Here, we introduce a functional-connectivity-based decoder, which accounts for the pairwise correlations between the spiking activities of neurons in each map and does not require any positional information, i.e. any knowledge about place fields. We first show, on recordings of hippocampal activity in constant environmental conditions, that our decoder outperforms existing decoding methods in {CA}1. Our decoder is then applied to data from teleportation experiments, in which an instantaneous switch between the environment identity triggers a recall of the corresponding spatial representation . We test the sensitivity of our approach on the transition dynamics between the respective memory states (maps). We find that the rate of spontaneous state shifts (flickering) after a teleportation event is increased not only within the first few seconds as already reported, but this instability is sustained across much longer ({\textgreater} 1 min.) periods.},

Experimental data show that different subsets of place cells are controlled by vision, self-motion or a combination of both. Moreover, recent studies in environments with a high degree of visual aliasing suggest that a continuous interaction between place cells and grid cells can result in a deformation of hexagonal grids or in a progressive loss of visual cue control over grid fields. The computational nature of such a bidirectional interaction remains unclear. In this work we present a neural network model of the dynamic interaction between place cells and grid cells within the entorhinal–hippocampal processing loop. The model was tested in two recent experimental paradigms involving environments with visually similar compartments that provided conflicting evidence about visual cue control over self-motion-based spatial codes. Analysis of the model behavior suggests that the strength of entorhinal–hippocampal dynamical loop is the key parameter governing differential cue control in multi-compartment environments. Moreover, construction of separate spatial representations of visually identical compartments required a progressive weakening of visual cue control over place fields in favor of self-motion based mechanisms. More generally our results suggest a functional segregation between plastic and dynamic processes in hippocampal processing.},

Although it is known that inhibitory synaptic strength is malleable, induction of long-term plasticity at distinct inhibitory synapses and its regulation of hippocampal network activity is not well understood. Here, we show that inhibitory synapses from parvalbumin and somatostatin expressing interneurons undergo long-term depression and potentiation respectively ({PV}-{iLTD} and {SST}-{iLTP}) during physiological activity patterns. Both forms of plasticity rely on T-type calcium channel activation to confer synapse specificity but otherwise employ distinct mechanisms. Since parvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons preferentially target perisomatic and distal dendritic regions respectively of {CA}1 pyramidal cells, {PV}-{iLTD} and {SST}-{iLTP} coordinate a reprioritisation of excitatory inputs from entorhinal cortex and {CA}3. Furthermore, circuit-level modelling reveals that {PV}-{iLTD} and {SST}-{iLTP} cooperate to stabilise place cells while facilitating representation of multiple unique environments within the hippocampal network.},

That is, glutamate released by repetitive activation of Schaffer collaterals activates group I metabotropic glutamate receptors at {CA}1 pyramidal cells, triggering a persistent reduction of {GABA} release that is mediated by endocannabinoids.

While theta phase coordination of spiking across entorhinal-hippocampal regions depended on memory demands, {LFP} gamma patterns below 100 Hz in the hippocampus were consistently layer specific and largely reflected afferent activity. Gamma synchronization as a mechanism for interregional communication thus rapidly loses efficacy at higher frequencies.},

Adaptive behavior requires the ability to analyze experience both prospectively and retrospectively. How can forward-ordered neural activity facilitate the storage or expression of reverse-ordered sequences? Wang et al. used multitetrode recordings from many individual hippocampal {CA}1 neurons in rats while simultaneously recording field potentials expressing theta oscillations. Spatial representation in the place cell network oscillated between forward and backward sweeps within each theta oscillation. Backward replay was associated with theta peaks, whereas forward replay was associated with theta troughs. Most cells fell into one category, but some corresponding to deep-layer neurons showed bimodular responses. Backward replay was driven by entorhinal inputs, whereas forward replay was evoked by {CA}3 inputs. These are important insights into the underlying basis of coding future and past experiences.
Science, this issue p. 247
Neural networks display the ability to transform forward-ordered activity patterns into reverse-ordered, retrospective sequences. The mechanisms underlying this transformation remain unknown. We discovered that, during active navigation, rat hippocampal {CA}1 place cell ensembles are inherently organized to produce independent forward- and reverse-ordered sequences within individual theta oscillations. This finding may provide a circuit-level basis for retrospective evaluation and storage during ongoing behavior. Theta phase procession arose in a minority of place cells, many of which displayed two preferred firing phases in theta oscillations and preferentially participated in reverse replay during subsequent rest. These findings reveal an unexpected aspect of theta-based hippocampal encoding and provide a biological mechanism to support the expression of reverse-ordered sequences.
Hippocampal place cell firing sequences represent future and past experiences.

A possible origin for the entorhinal speed signal is the mesencephalic locomotor region ({MLR}), which is critically involved in the activation of locomotor programs. Here, we describe, in rats, a circuit connecting the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus ({PPN}) of the {MLR} to the {MEC} via the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca ({HDB}). At each level of this pathway, locomotion speed is linearly encoded in neuronal firing rates. Optogenetic activation of {PPN} cells drives locomotion and modulates activity of speed-modulated neurons in {HDB} and {MEC}. Our results provide evidence for a pathway by which brainstem speed signals can reach cortical structures implicated in navigation and higher-order dynamic representations of space.},

During subsequent sharp-wave ripples ({SPW}-Rs), the newly acquired hippocampal information is transferred to the neocortex and stored as a long-lasting memory trace. Consistent with this hypothesis, waking theta states and {SPW}-Rs distinctly control information flow in the hippocampal–entorhinal loop. Although both waking theta states and rapid eye movement ({REM}) sleep are characterized by prominent hippocampal theta oscillations, the two brain states involve distinct temporal coordination and oscillatory coupling in the hippocampal–entorhinal circuit. While distinct brain states have distinct network dynamics, firing rates of individual neurons in the hippocampal–entorhinal circuitry follow lognormal-like distributions in all states. Firing rates of the same neurons are positively correlated across brain states and testing environments, suggesting that memory is allocated in preconfigured, rather than tabula rasa-type, skewed neuronal networks. The fast-firing minority and slow-firing majority neurons, which can support network stability and flexibility, are under distinct homeostatic regulations that are initiated by spindles and {SPW}-Rs during slow wave sleep and implemented during subsequent {REM} sleep.},

Recent results show that {LTP} can indeed occur at synapses on distal dendrites of hippocampal {CA}1 neurons, even in the absence of a postsynaptic somatic spike. Instead, local dendritic spikes contribute to the depolarization required to induce {LTP}.

We have found that {CA}1 interneuron circuits are also reconfigured during goal-oriented spatial learning through modification of inputs from pyramidal cells. As learning progressed, new pyramidal assemblies expressed in theta cycles alternated with previously established ones, and eventually overtook them. The firing patterns of interneurons developed a relationship to new, learning-related assemblies: some interneurons associated their activity with new pyramidal assemblies while some others dissociated from them. These firing associations were explained by changes in the weight of monosynaptic inputs received by interneurons from new pyramidal assemblies, as these predicted the associational changes. Spatial learning thus engages circuit modifications in the hippocampus that incorporate a redistribution of inhibitory activity that might assist in the segregation of competing pyramidal cell assembly patterns in space and time.},

	abstract = {Gap junctions allow direct electrical communication between {CNS} neurons. From theoretical and modeling studies, it is well known that although gap junctions can act to synchronize network output, they can also give rise to many other dynamic patterns including antiphase and other phase-locked states. The particular network pattern that arises depends on cellular, intrinsic properties that affect firing frequencies as well as the strength and location of the gap junctions. Interneurons or {GABAergic} neurons in hippocampus are diverse in their cellular characteristics and have been shown to have active dendrites. Furthermore, parvalbumin-positive {GABAergic} neurons, also known as basket cells, can contact one another via gap junctions on their distal dendrites. Using two-cell network models, we explore how distal electrical connections affect network output. We build multi-compartment models of hippocampal basket cells using {NEURON} and endow them with varying amounts of active dendrites. Two-cell networks of these model cells as well as reduced versions are explored. The relationship between intrinsic frequency and the level of active dendrites allows us to define three regions based on what sort of network dynamics occur with distal gap junction coupling. Weak coupling theory is used to predict the delineation of these regions as well as examination of phase response curves and distal dendritic polarization levels. We find that a nonmonotonic dependence of network dynamic characteristics (phase lags) on gap junction conductance occurs. This suggests that distal electrical coupling and active dendrite levels can control how sensitive network dynamics are to gap junction modulation. With the extended geometry, gap junctions located at more distal locations must have larger conductances for pure synchrony to occur. Furthermore, based on simulations with heterogeneous networks, it may be that one requires active dendrites if phase-locking is to occur in networks formed with distal gap junctions.},

	abstract = {Diverse computations in the neocortex are aided by specialized {GABAergic} interneurons ({INs}), which selectively target other {INs}. However, much less is known about how these canonical disinhibitory circuit motifs contribute to network operations supporting spatial navigation and learning in the hippocampus. Using chronic two-photon calcium imaging in mice performing random foraging or goal-oriented learning tasks, we found that vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-expressing ({VIP}+), disinhibitory {INs} in hippocampal area {CA}1 form functional subpopulations defined by their modulation by behavioral states and task demands. Optogenetic manipulations of {VIP}+ {INs} and computational modeling further showed that {VIP}+ disinhibition is necessary for goal-directed learning and related reorganization of hippocampal pyramidal cell population dynamics. Our results demonstrate that disinhibitory circuits in the hippocampus play an active role in supporting spatial learning.

	abstract = {Theta phase modulates gamma amplitude during spatial navigation and rapid eye movement sleep ({REMs}). Although the {REMs} theta rhythm has been linked to spatial memory consolidation, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We investigate dynamics of theta-gamma interactions across multiple frequency and temporal scales in simultaneous recordings from hippocampal {CA}3, {CA}1, subiculum, and parietal cortex. We show that theta phase significantly modulates three distinct gamma bands during {REMs}, dynamically. Interestingly, we further show that theta-gamma coupling swings between different hippocampal and cortical structures during {REMs} and tends to increase over a single {REMs} episode. Comparing to active wake, theta-gamma coupling during {REMs} is significantly increased for subicular and cortical, but not for {CA}3 and {CA}1, recordings. Finally, optogenetic silencing of septohippocampal {GABAergic} projections significantly impedes both theta-gamma coupling and theta phase coherence, two neural mechanisms of working and long-term memory, respectively. Thus, we show that theta-gamma coupling and theta phase coherence are highly modulated during single {REMs} episode and propose that theta-gamma coupling provides a predominant mechanism for information processing within each brain region, while the orchestrated nature of coupling activity establishes a specific phase-space coding of information during sleep.},

	abstract = {Oscillatory brain activity reflects different internal brain states including neurons’ excitatory state and synchrony among neurons. However, characterizing these states is complicated by the fact that different oscillations are often coupled, such as gamma oscillations nested in theta in the hippocampus, and changes in coupling are thought to reflect distinct states. Here, we describe a new method to separate single oscillatory cycles into distinct states based on frequency and phase coupling. Using this method, we identified four theta-gamma coupling states in rat hippocampal {CA}1. These states differed in abundance across behaviors, phase synchrony with other hippocampal subregions, and neural coding properties suggesting that these states are functionally distinct. We captured cycle-to-cycle changes in oscillatory coupling states and found frequent switching between theta-gamma states showing that the hippocampus rapidly shifts between different functional states. This method provides a new approach to investigate oscillatory brain dynamics broadly.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Temporal coupling between theta and gamma oscillations is a hallmark activity pattern of several cortical networks and becomes especially prominent during {REM} sleep. In a parallel approach, nasal breathing has been recently shown to generate phase-entrained network oscillations which also modulate gamma. Both slow rhythms (theta and respiration-entrained oscillations) have been suggested to aid large-scale integration but they differ in frequency, display low coherence, and modulate different gamma sub-bands. Respiration and theta are therefore believed to be largely independent. In the present work, however, we report an unexpected but robust relation between theta-gamma coupling and respiration in mice. Interestingly, this relation takes place not through the phase of individual respiration cycles, but through respiration rate: the strength of theta-gamma coupling exhibits an inverted V-shaped dependence on breathing rate, leading to maximal coupling at breathing frequencies of 4-6 Hz. Noteworthy, when subdividing sleep epochs into phasic and tonic {REM} patterns, we find that breathing differentially relates to theta-gamma coupling in each state, providing new evidence for their physiological distinctiveness. Altogether, our results reveal that breathing correlates with brain activity not only through phase-entrainment but also through rate-dependent relations with theta-gamma coupling. Thus, the link between respiration and other patterns of cortical network activity is more complex than previously assumed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In neuronal networks, the gamma frequency oscillation is thought to be important for several higher-end cognitive processes, such as attention and memory. Coordinated firing by widely distributed cells is required to produce an oscillation, but this network activity can be quite variable. It is not clear why gamma oscillations should differ so greatly across time and space. New evidence reveals that information trafficking within the hippocampus and parts of temporal cortex is dependent upon the speed of gamma. Faster oscillations link entorhinal cortex to {CA}1, providing information on the animal's location, while slower oscillations link {CA}1 to {CA}3 for information storage. Thus, one possible function underlying a variable gamma is to properly route information within a circuit.},
